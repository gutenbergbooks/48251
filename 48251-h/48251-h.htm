<h1 title="">THE BOY SCOUTS
<br />DOWN IN DIXIE</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="small">KHAKI BOYS IN THE SUNNY SOUTHLAND.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s always the way it goes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter with you now, Step
Hen; you seem in a peck of trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who wouldn&rsquo;t be, when some fellow went and
hid his hat away? Didn&rsquo;t you all see me hang the
same on this peg sticking out from the trunk of the
pine tree, when we-all came ashore to eat lunch; because
that&rsquo;s what I did, as sure as anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you think so, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it as well as I know my name. Think
because I&rsquo;ve got a stuffy cold in my head just like
Bumpus here says he has, and can&rsquo;t smell, that I
don&rsquo;t know beans, do you? Well, you can see for
yourself, Davy Jones, my nice new campaign hat
ain&rsquo;t on the peg right now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know why that&rsquo;s true, Step Hen? Because
a thing never yet was known to be in two
places at the same time. And unless my eyes are
telling me what ain&rsquo;t so, you&rsquo;ve got your hat on
right at this minute, pushed back on your head!
Told you, boys, Step Hen ought to get a pair of
specs; now I&rsquo;m dead sure of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy who seemed to answer to the queer name
of Step Hen threw up a hand, and on discovering
that he did have his hat perched away back on his
bushy head of hair, made out to be quite indignant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, that&rsquo;s the way you play tricks on travelers,
is it? I&rsquo;d just like to know who put that hat on my
head so sly like! Mr. Scout-master, I wish you&rsquo;d
tell the fellows who love to play pranks to let me
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad to, Step Hen, only in this case I
happened to see you take your hat down, and clap it
on your own head, though I reckon you did it without
thinking what you were doing; so the sooner
you forget it the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A general laugh arose at this, and Step Hen, subsiding,
continued to munch away at the sandwich he
gripped in one hand. There were just eight lads,
dressed in the khaki suits of Boy Scouts, some of
which were new, and others rather seedy, as though
they had seen many a campaign. But those who
wore the brightest uniforms did so because their
others had become almost disreputable, and fit only
to be carried along for use in case of absolute
necessity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>While they sit there, enjoying their midday meal,
with two pretty good-sized paddling boats tied up,
showing just how they managed to reach this lonely
place on the border of one of the almost impenetrable
swamps in Southern Louisiana, let us
take advantage of the stop to say a few words concerning
these lively lads.</p>
<p>Of course the boy reader who has had the pleasure
of possessing any or all of the previous volumes
in this series, will readily recognize these sturdy fellows
as the full membership of the Silver Fox
Patrol connected with Cranford Troop of Boy
Scouts.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Assistant Scout-master
Thad Brewster they had been having some pretty
lively outings for the last two years; at one time
in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina;
then up in Maine; afterwards finding a chance to
pay a hunting and exploring trip to the far distant
Rocky Mountains, and finally on the preceding summer
cruising upon the vast stretches of Lake Superior.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>Besides the patrol leader, Thad, there were Allan
Hollister, who had seen much actual life in the
woods, and was perfectly at home there; a tall lanky
fellow, with such a long neck that his chums had
long ago named him &ldquo;Giraffe;&rdquo; a dumpy, fat scout,
whose jolly red face was almost the color of his
hair, and who came when any one called &ldquo;Bumpus;&rdquo;
a very neat and handsome boy who had been
christened Edmund Maurice Travers Smith, but
who did not object when all that was shortened to
just plain, every-day &ldquo;Smithy;&rdquo; an acrobatic chap
who loved to stand on his head, and play monkey,
Davy Jones by name; Step Hen himself, otherwise
Stephen Bingham; and last but not least one Robert
Quail White, a native of the South, and whose
rather odd name was soon happily changed among
his mates to plain &ldquo;Bob White,&rdquo; which, as all boys
know, is the popular way a quail is designated in the
country.</p>
<p>It might as well be said right here in the start
that Bumpus was also occasionally at school and
at home addressed as Cornelius Hawtree; and that
Giraffe would come to a meal if some one called
softly &ldquo;Conrad Stedman;&rdquo; because he was very,
very fond of responding to any sort of a summons
that had something to eat along with it.</p>
<p>These eight boys did not constitute the whole of
Cranford Troop, for there was another full patrol
enlisted, and part of a third; but they were all
boon companions; and chancing to have a snug
amount of hard cash in the treasury of the patrol,
separate from the troop amount, they were enabled
to take advantage of a golden opportunity to visit
the far South in the dead of winter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>It chanced that they were talking about this right
then and there, so that by listening for a bit we
may learn what unusual circumstances had arisen
to give the scouts this wonderful chance to take a
vacation, when they apparently should be industriously
working at their books in the Cranford
High School, to which all of them belonged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can say what you like,&rdquo; Giraffe was remarking,
as he carefully drained the coffee-pot into
his tin cup, that being his third allowance; &ldquo;I think
the Silver Fox Patrol was hatched out under a
lucky star. We&rsquo;ve had heaps and heaps of good
things happen to us in times past; and now just
to think that the old frame building we&rsquo;ve been using
for a high school for years, should go and take
fire and burn to the ground, a month or six weeks
before the new brick schoolhouse could be furnished
and heated, compelling the Board to dismiss
school for that time. Let me tell you it&rsquo;s a mighty
bad wind that blows good to nobody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s only a part of our great good luck,
and you forget that, Giraffe,&rdquo; insisted Davy Jones,
nodding his head, eagerly, as he looked around at
the live oak trees, in the crooked and wide spreading
branches of which he expected to soon be sporting,
holding on with his toes, and swinging from
limb to limb with the abandon of an ape.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to be sure, I had ought to enumerate the
rest!&rdquo; declared the lanky member of the patrol.
&ldquo;Think of it, how just after that sad catastrophe&mdash;excuse
me, boys, while I wipe a tear away in memory
of that poor old schoolhouse&mdash;there was that
strange letter came to Thad&rsquo;s bully old guardian,
Daddy Caleb Cushman Brewster, from a man he
used to know years ago. It was written from
down here in Southern Louisiana, and told how the
writer had seen one Felix Jasper, with a very pretty
if ragged little girl in his company, hurrying along
a lonely trail that led into old Alligator Swamp, and
acting like he had recognized the gentleman, and
was afraid to let him come any closer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; spoke up Thad, who in the absence of the
regular scout-master, Dr. Philander Hobbs, always
acted as the leader of the troop, &ldquo;and all of you
chance to know that years ago, when I was much
smaller, and lived in another town, that man Felix
Jasper was the manager of my mother&rsquo;s estate, and
was found to be stealing from her, so he was discharged.
Later on my only little sister, Pauline,
strangely disappeared, and could never be found.
It was believed at the time that Jasper in a spirit of
revenge had stolen the little child, but he could not
be located; and the grief of that loss I really believe
hastened the death of my dear mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad was so overcome with emotion that he could
not go on. His chums cast sympathetic looks at
him, for they were very fond of their leader; then
Allan Hollister took up the narrative by saying:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>&ldquo;And his gentleman who happened to glimpse
the man and girl, and who had known of the circumstances
in the past, wrote that he felt almost
certain he had been looking on the face of the long-lost
little Brewster girl. Daddy was laid up with
one of his attacks of rheumatism; and besides, he
could never have stood such a trip. So he put up an
unlimited amount of spending money, enough to allow
the whole patrol to make the trip by rail; and
here we are, determined to stand by our chum, and
penetrate this dismal Louisiana swamp to find out
whether it is Thad&rsquo;s sister and Felix Jasper who are
living somewhere about here; or if the gentleman
made a bad mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; went on Bob White, impulsively, for he
was a true, warm-hearted Southern boy, a little
touchy with regard to his &ldquo;honor,&rdquo; but a splendid
and loyal comrade for all that, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;re bound
to do it, I reckon, suh, or know the reason why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing we did when we got down here,&rdquo;
Giraffe went on to say, &ldquo;was to pick up all the information
connected with this swamp we could,
which was not a great lot, because they seem to
think it&rsquo;s a terrible place, and few persons ever
dream of penetrating its unexplored depths, except
now and then a muskrat trapper, or an alligator-skin
collector; though they do say it&rsquo;s been an asylum
for occasional negro convicts who broke away
from the turpentine camps and were pursued by the
dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! looks some like we might be up against
the toughest proposition we ever tackled, believe
me,&rdquo; Step Hen observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Bumpus, composedly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
pretty nearly always come out on top, haven&rsquo;t we;
and according to my notion we&rsquo;re strong enough to
do it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something pretty strong around here,
and that&rsquo;s a fact,&rdquo; spoke up Giraffe as he changed
his seat. &ldquo;I wonder, now, if the decaying vegetation
in these here old Louisiana swamps always tone
up the air like that. Smells to me kind of like rank
onions that have got past the useful and respectable
stage. I can see how we&rsquo;re bound to have a high
old time if this is a specimen of swamp air, and we
expect to breathe it for mebbe two whole weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! say, that ain&rsquo;t hardly fair!&rdquo; remarked Davy
Jones; &ldquo;alaying it all on the poor old swamp, when,
honest Injun, I&rsquo;ve been asniffing that same queer
odor all day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked straight and hard at Bumpus as he
said this. The fat scout immediately frowned as
though he felt hurt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re ahinting at, Davy Jones,&rdquo;
he remarked, hotly; &ldquo;just because I choose to continue
wearing my old suit, and keep the new one for
another day you like to make out this outfit ain&rsquo;t
all right. I admit she looks a mite greasy, because
I&rsquo;ve helped cook many a fine meal while wearing the
same. There&rsquo;s <i>associations</i> wrapped up with every
inch of this faded cloth, and you can laugh all you
want to, but I decline to throw it away while on
this trip. What&rsquo;s a swamp but a muddy hole, and
I don&rsquo;t choose to spoil my brand new suit, if you
do. Besides, Step Hen and me, we&rsquo;ve got such
stuffy colds in our heads we can&rsquo;t smell a single
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then for goodness sake, change places with me,
and be a chum of Step Hen&rsquo;s during the remainder
of this whole trip. Besides,&rdquo; added Giraffe, as he
saw Bumpus getting as red as a turkey gobbler with
indignation, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll balance the two boats better, I&rsquo;m
thinking. How about that, Mr. Scout-master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was figuring that we could do better than we
have so far; and if Bumpus is willing to change
with you, let him,&rdquo; replied Thad. &ldquo;That will bring
him in my boat with Davy and Step Hen. They
say colds like that are catching, so perhaps both
Davy and myself will soon have one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! I hope so,&rdquo; muttered the Jones boy,
sniffing the air suspiciously when poor Bumpus
happened to move to windward of him; but the usually
good-natured fat boy pretended not to notice
the slur.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as we&rsquo;re all through lunch, let&rsquo;s make a
start, for we expect to be deep in Alligator swamp
long before night comes on,&rdquo; said Allan, who had
the second paddling boat, fashioned somewhat after
the pattern of the old-fashioned dug-out canoe made
from a log, in his charge, being the assistant patrol
leader of the Silver Fox band.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, and having packed all their
stuff away, the boys were ready to continue their
journey into the depths of the thickening wilderness
where the hanging Spanish moss that draped the
trees proved such a strange sight to them all, and
gave such a graveyard look to their surroundings
that more than one of them felt a little shiver of
apprehension, as though they fancied all manner of
mysteries must presently arise to confront them.</p>
<p>The boat containing Giraffe, Allan, Bob White
and Smithy happened to be ahead when they came
to where their progress was hindered somewhat by
floating logs and other stuff; so Giraffe, without being
told to do the same, stood up in the bow to
punch his way clear. He made a vicious stab at
what he thought was a floating log, but had no
sooner struck his paddle against it than the seemingly
harmless object made a sudden lunge, splashed
water all over the boat, and disappeared from sight;
while the astonished boy, losing his balance as his
paddle slipped off the scaly armor of the old mossback
alligator that had been sleeping so placidly on
the surface of the lagoon that it had not noticed
their approach, fell in with a tremendous splurge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small">AMONG THE PUZZLING SWAMP WATER TRAILS.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Alligator!&rdquo; shrieked Smithy; and as this
was the very first saurian he had ever set eyes on,
not in confinement, his excitement was hardly to
be wondered at.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lookout, Giraffe, he&rsquo;s after you!&rdquo; cried Bumpus,
from the other boat, close by.</p>
<p>There was no need of spurring the lanky scout
on to any further exertions; for he had comprehended
that the living log was a scaly reptile, even
before he took that involuntary bath; and the instant
that his head came above the surface again
he made frantic haste to clamber back into the boat.</p>
<p>Allan had instantly stooped, and possessed himself
of a repeating Marlin rifle, which he kept
handy at all times now; and had that &rsquo;gator attempted
anything like hostile action, the chances
were that he must speedily have made the acquaintance
of a soft-nosed bullet that would probably have
finished his earthly career in a hurry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>No doubt the denizen of the swamp was even
more badly frightened than Giraffe, for after that
one whirl and splash nobody ever saw him more.
But then, how was the lanky scout to know that?
Imagination peopled that dark waters with a myriad
of twelve-foot &rsquo;gators, all plunging toward the spot
where he was struggling to drag himself back into
the boat, though his soaked garments seemed to
weigh very nearly a whole ton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lookout, Giraffe, or you&rsquo;ll upset us all!&rdquo;
shouted Bob White, who probably did not see any
great reason for all this haste, because conditions
always color such things differently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me in, somebody, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; gasped the
clinging boy. &ldquo;Want to see me bit in half, do
you? Thad, you lend me a hand, since these other
fellows won&rsquo;t? Oh! what was that?&rdquo; as a great
splash was heard; but of course it was only Bumpus
playfully striking at the water with the flat
of his paddle, on pretense of &ldquo;shooing&rdquo; away the
sportive and hungry alligator, though no doubt he
had also in mind the idea of hastening Giraffe&rsquo;s getting
over the gunwale on wings of fear.</p>
<p>They managed to pull him aboard, where he stood
looking all around, as though in the end a trifle disappointed
not to see a few monsters showing their
keen regret at being cheated out of a meal; for that
would have always added flavor to the story when
he came to tell it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;Guess he&rsquo;s gone down to the bottom!&rdquo; suggested
Giraffe; &ldquo;I kicked with all my might all the
time I was in the water, and that&rsquo;s the only way
to scare a &rsquo;gator, a coon told me. But you can
laugh all you&rsquo;ve a mind to, Step Hen and Bumpus,
I reckon you&rsquo;d a done as much as I did if it&rsquo;d been
you fell in. Why, I saw him open his jaws, and I
declare to goodness, he had a mouth big enough
to swallow a sugar barrel, and that&rsquo;s the honest
truth, fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see plain enough that we&rsquo;re due for some
rattling lively times while we&rsquo;re down in old Louisiana,&ldquo;
remarked Smithy. &ldquo;But if you don&rsquo;t mind,
Thad, please paddle your craft a little more to the
left, because the breeze is blowing straight from
you to us, and, well, you know what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus was feeling so hilarious over seeing that
great splash taken by his persecutor, Giraffe, that
he did not pay the slightest attention to what Smithy
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, fellows,&rdquo; the fat scout went on to
remark, &ldquo;up to now it&rsquo;s been poor old Bumpus
who&rsquo;s generally gone overboard, or got in trouble
like that; but seems as if times have changed, and
now Giraffe, he wants to take his turn. If I&rsquo;d
been close enough, and had a boat-hook handy, sure
I&rsquo;d a got it fast in the collar of your jacket, Giraffe.
And I&rsquo;d a considered it a pleasure, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, I reckon you would, Bumpus;
you&rsquo;re an <i>aw</i>ful accommodating chum, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
the tall scout sneered. &ldquo;But see here, whatever
am I to do now, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit in the sun, and let your duds dry on you!&rdquo;
suggested one comrade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only trouble is, we have to bail out the
boat, because he&rsquo;s nearly flooded us right now,&rdquo;
Bob White asserted, beginning to get busy with a
big sponge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had I ought to make a change, Thad?&rdquo; demanded
Giraffe, ignoring these side thrusts, and appealing
to the fountain head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just suit yourself,&rdquo; replied the scout-master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I mean to do, only this is my new
suit, and I kinder hate to put it up to dry, for fear
it&rsquo;ll shrink on me, and I can&rsquo;t get out of it again,&rdquo;
the lanky one went on to say.</p>
<p>Presently, as the air under the trees was not so
warm as if they had had more sunshine, and Giraffe
commenced to shiver, Thad told him he had
better make the change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can wear your old suit right along, if you
have to,&rdquo; he remarked; &ldquo;and even if you have to
throw away the other, better do that than get a heavy
cold from trying to let it dry on you. That&rsquo;s all
very well in hot August weather; but there&rsquo;s a little
tang in the air, even away down South here, along
in December. So strip to the skin, and make yourself
comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>Giraffe concluded that after all this was the best
policy; and so he set to work, paying little heed to
the jests of his chums, who, like all boys, could
never let so good a chance to joke an unlucky companion
pass by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next time you see a log, Giraffe,&rdquo; Bumpus told
him, &ldquo;take a second look before you go to punch
it with your paddle. They say logs down here have
got <i>teeth</i>, and can take a big bite right out of an
oar. We don&rsquo;t want to lose any of our paddles;
and let me warn you that it&rsquo;s risky jumping overboard
after one when you do drop it in the drink.
We&rsquo;d hate to see you make a meal for a hungry
&rsquo;gator; though for that matter it&rsquo;d be a pretty slim
dinner he&rsquo;d get!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, one thing sure,&rdquo; retorted the tall scout,
who was now fully dressed, and feeling in readiness
to do battle again; &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t blame any old &rsquo;gator
if he declined to gobble <i>you</i> for a relish right now,
and that&rsquo;s what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you go again, but on account of your recent
trouble I&rsquo;ll let it pass. A fellow that has just
been nearly scared to death ain&rsquo;t responsible for
half he says,&rdquo; and the fat boy waved his hand toward
the other as though he really meant it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;From the way you&rsquo;ve been pestering us lately
about that stuff you forgot to take home to your
mother from the drug store, I&rsquo;d think you had
troubles of your own to bother about,&rdquo; retorted Giraffe.
&ldquo;I never saw such a fellow to keep thinking
of little things that don&rsquo;t amount to a row of
beans. Why, you admit it only cost five cents, and
yet to hear you let out a howl about it every little
while, you&rsquo;d think it was worth a whole dollar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; said Bumpus, with dignity, &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;m so built that when anything gets on my nerves
like that has, I just can&rsquo;t sleep till I&rsquo;ve solved the
puzzle. Did I take that little package home and
give it to my mother, or did I leave it anywhere on
the way? That&rsquo;s the question I&rsquo;d like to have
solved; and I mean it shall be, if I have to write to
three separate boys whose houses I stopped in on
my way home, to tell &rsquo;em what a ge-lorious time I
expected to have down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you did write to your mother from Memphis,
to ask her about it; and when we got letters
back at that last town you nearly took a fit because
there wasn&rsquo;t any for you,&rdquo; Davy Jones went on
to say, taking a hand in the affair, though he was
as far away from Bumpus in the other end of the
boat as he could possibly get.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very true,&rdquo; replied the fat scout, composedly;
&ldquo;and now I&rsquo;ve got to just hold in, and
wait a long time till we get more mail. It bothers
me more&rsquo;n words can tell you. A scout should
never fail in his duty; and my mother said she
wanted what she wrote on that paper the worst
kind. What if it was only five cents; I&rsquo;m not thinking
of the amount, but the fulfilling of my duty.
Thad always says that&rsquo;s the main thing to consider.
Faithful in little things, is my motto.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hear! hear!&rdquo; cheered Bob White, from the
other boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good boy, Bumpus! them&rsquo;s our sentiments,
too!&rdquo; declared Step Hen, hilariously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! little things, hey?&rdquo; sniffed Giraffe;
&ldquo;please get busy fellows, and draw ahead of our
friends in the other boat once more. Seems to me
the air is better up ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But make him beware of the logs, mind you,&rdquo;
called Bumpus, as a parting shot.</p>
<p>They proceeded carefully along for some time.
The channel they were following seemed to be very
winding, and yet there could be no reasonable doubt
but that it was constantly taking the expedition
deeper into the great Alligator Swamp all the time.</p>
<p>Thad had tried to get all the information possible
about the strange place he intended to visit, but
few people could assist him. One man gladly allowed
him to have a very rude chart that he said
&ldquo;Alligator&rdquo; Smith, who made a practice of hunting
the denizens of the swamp for their skins, had
once drawn for him, with a bit of charcoal, and a
piece of wrapping paper. This was when the
&ldquo;cracker&rdquo; had lost a heifer which he suspected had
either strayed into the fastnesses of the swamp; or
else been killed, and eaten by some &ldquo;hideout&rdquo; escaped
convicts, who found a refuge from pursuit
within the almost impenetrable depths of the extensive
morass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>There were things about this chart which none of
them could fully grasp. Thad had some hopes of
being fortunate enough to come upon the man who
had drawn it, as he was said to be somewhere about,
pursuing his queer vocation of acquiring a living
from securing the skins of alligators he managed to
shoot or trap.</p>
<p>And it was in this way that the eight chums had
actually dared to start into one of the least known
places in the whole State of Louisiana. Some of
those with whom they had spoken about their intended
trip had warned them not to attempt such a
risky thing without a guide. But Thad was fairly
wild to learn whether there could be any truth in the
strange story that had come to his guardian in that
letter; and he just felt that he could not stand the
suspense another day.</p>
<p>Inquiry had developed the fact that inside of the
last few months a man and a little girl had really
been seen several times, though nobody knew where
he stayed; and some said they had seen him paddling
out of the swamp in a pirogue, which had evidently
been fashioned from the trunk of a big tree
with considerable skill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>As the afternoon advanced, and they found themselves
getting deeper and deeper in the gloomy
swamp, the boys began to realize that this singular
expedition might not turn out to be such a pleasant
picnic after all. There was always a peril hovering
over them that must not be lightly treated; and this
was the danger of losing themselves in those winding
channels; for they had been told that more than
once men had gone into Alligator Swamp never to
be seen again by their fellows.</p>
<p>Thad and Allan had arranged a plan whereby
they might mark their way; and if it came to the
worst they would stand a chance of returning over
the same passages that they were following in entering
the place.</p>
<p>They did this first by attaching a small white
piece of cloth to a bush while still in sight of the
last one that had been marked. When these finally
gave out they proceeded to break a branch, and allow
it to hang in a certain way that was bound to
catch their eye, and tell them how to paddle in
order to keep passing along the chain.</p>
<p>This was a well-known method among woodsmen
in these great swamps, where one can be
turned around so easily, and all things look so much
alike that even the best of experienced paddlers
may make mistakes that are apt to cost dearly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>The boys fell quiet as the shadows lengthened.
To tell the truth all of them were growing a bit
tired from this constant paddling, and twisting their
heads in trying to see so many sights at once; and
when Giraffe hinted broadly that in his opinion he
thought it might be high time they picked out some
nice spot for stopping over, so that the fire could
be started, and supper gotten underway, nearly all
the rest gave him a smile of encouragement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I was thinking about myself,&rdquo; said
Thad; &ldquo;and unless I&rsquo;m mistaken, right now I
glimpse the place we&rsquo;re looking for; because, you
understand, we ought to have a good high and dry
spot for a camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know whether these here &rsquo;gators can
climb, Thad?&rdquo; asked the fat scout, a little nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a tree, certain sure, Bumpus, so you&rsquo;re safe,
if you only show enough speed in getting up among
the branches; but they just <i>love</i> to slide down banks,
they say, and don&rsquo;t you go to depending on any such
to keep your scaly friends from sharing your
blanket,&rdquo; Davy remarked, maliciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! who&rsquo;s afraid; not me?&rdquo; sang out Bumpus,
puffing out his chest as he spoke; &ldquo;besides, haven&rsquo;t
I got a gun along with me this trip; and some of
you happen to know that I can use the same. I&rsquo;ve
got a few crack shots to my credit, ain&rsquo;t I, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the scout-master could either affirm or
deny this assertion, Giraffe gave a loud yell, and
was seen to be standing up in his boat, pointing
wildly ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;Looky there, would you, boys!&rdquo; he cried;
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s a coon in the boat, seems like to me, and
he&rsquo;s paddling like everything to get away from us.
What say, shall we give chase, and see if four pair
of arms are better than one? Maybe, now, it&rsquo;s only
a hideout darky, scared nigh to death athinking
we&rsquo;re the soldiers come hunting after him. And
then again, how d&rsquo;we know that it mightn&rsquo;t be
Felix himself; because, you remember, they did say
he was burnt as brown as mahogany! Whoop! see
him make that paddle fairly burn the air; and ain&rsquo;t
he flying to beat the band, though? Thad, why
<i>don&rsquo;t</i> you give the word to chase after him, when
you can see we&rsquo;re all crazy to let out top-notch
speed.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small">CAMP-FARE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hold up!&rdquo; called out Thad.</p>
<p>Of course, as the scout-master, his word had to
be recognized as law by the members of Cranford
Troop. Several of the boys manifested signs of
disappointment, and impulsive Giraffe seemed to be
the chief offender.</p>
<p>As a rule they were not averse to giving vent to
their feelings; for besides being Boy Scouts, they
had long been school chums.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s too bad, now, Thad,&rdquo; Giraffe remarked,
dejectedly; &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t want us to chase
after that fellow. Four of us ought to&rsquo;ve been
able to beat him in a furious dash; and how d&rsquo;we
know but what it isn&rsquo;t the very man we&rsquo;ve come all
the way from Cranford to see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late now, anyway!&rdquo; observed Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s disappearing among the shadows yonder,&rdquo;
said Davy, who had sharp eyesight; &ldquo;and I saw
him turn to look back at us just when he was passing
through that bar of sunlight that crosses the
water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you think he was a negro, or a white man,
Davy?&rdquo; asked Thad, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to tell you the truth, Thad, I guess now
he <i>was</i> a coon, all right. He didn&rsquo;t have any hat on,
and his hair seemed woolly enough,&rdquo; Davy admitted,
frankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought as much all along,&rdquo; Thad told them,
&ldquo;and that was one of the reasons I wouldn&rsquo;t give
the word to pursue him. There were plenty of
others, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name a few, Mr. Scout-master,&rdquo; requested
Giraffe, still unconvinced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! well, for instance, we&rsquo;re all pretty tired as
it is, and to make that dash would wear us out.
Then we&rsquo;d lose the chance for camping on this spot
here that I picked out, and we might go a long way
without running across as good a one. And if it
was a black outlaw, one of those desperate escaped
convicts from the turpentine camps, if they have
them in Louisiana, even should we manage to overtake
him he might happen to have a gun of some
kind. You could hardly blame him for showing
fight, Giraffe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not when you remember that we&rsquo;re wearing
uniforms pretty much like the National Guard, and
chances are he believed we were real soldiers, not tin
ones,&rdquo; was the contribution of Step Hen, easily convinced,
after he had given the subject a little reflection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; added Bumpus, as a clincher that he
knew would catch the lanky scout; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nearly
time we&rsquo;re thinking of having supper; and sure, it
would be too bad if we had to postpone trying that
delicious home-cured ham we fetched along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The frown left the forehead of Giraffe like magic,
and in its place came a most heavenly smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I surrender, boys!&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;I throw
up my hands, and give in. Seems like everybody&rsquo;s
against me, and seven to one is big odds. Must
be I&rsquo;m mistaken. If it was a genuine coon after all,
why, sure we&rsquo;d a been silly to waste our precious
muscle achasing after him. Besides, looks like the
shadows are acreeping out along there, and we&rsquo;d as
like as not get lost somehow. Oh! you&rsquo;re right, as
usual, Mr. Scout-master. I&rsquo;m always letting my
ambition run away with my horse sense. Seems
like I never open my mouth but I put my foot in
it, somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you get a button, and keep it
shut?&rdquo; asked Bumpus, promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would, if it was the size of some I&rsquo;ve known,&rdquo;
responded Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope now, you ain&rsquo;t making wicked comparisons?&rdquo;
the fat scout demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be guilty of such unbrotherly
kindness, do you?&rdquo; was Giraffe&rsquo;s perplexing
rejoinder; and knowing that he could not
get the better of the tall scout Bumpus gave a
grunt, and stopped short.</p>
<p>They were soon busily engaged in making preparations
for camping. Having come all the way
from home with the idea of spending some time in
the Southern swamp, looking for those whom Thad
so earnestly wished to meet face to face, the lads
had of course made ample preparations for having
at least a fair degree of comfort.</p>
<p>None of them had ever been in the Far South,
so all they knew about the country, its animals, and
the habits of its people, must come through reading,
and observation as they went along.</p>
<p>But they did know the comfort of a tight waterproof
canvas tent in case of a heavy rain storm; and
consequently a good part of the luggage they carried
in the three trunks had been a couple of such
coverings, besides the usual camp outfit about which
many happy associations of the past were clinging.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>These trunks had of course been left in the small
town where they had obtained the roughly made
canoes, to be picked up on their return later.</p>
<p>Long experience had made every one of them
clever hands at tent-raising; and from the way
Smithy and Davy undertook to get one up in advance
of Step Hen and Bob White, it was plain to
see that the old-time spirit of rivalry still held
good.</p>
<p>Giraffe as usual took it upon himself to start the
cooking fire. He was what the other boys called
a &ldquo;crank&rdquo; at fire-building, and had long ago demonstrated
his ability to start a blaze without a single
match, by any one of several ancient methods, such
as using a little bow that twirled a sharp-pointed
stick so rapidly in a wooden socket that a spark
was generated, which in turn quickly communicated
to a minute amount of inflammable material,
and was then coaxed along until a fire resulted.</p>
<p>Bumpus always stood ready to assist in the cooking
operations; because there were so many other
things coming along that required dexterity and
agility, and from which his size and clumsiness debarred
him, that he just felt as though he must be
doing something in order to shoulder his share of
the work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>As the twilight quickly deepened into night&mdash;for
in the South there is not a very long interval between
the going down of the sun, and the pinning of
the curtains of darkness&mdash;the scene became quite an
animated one, with eight lively lads moving around,
each fulfilling some self-imposed duty that would
add to the comfort and happiness of the patrol in
camp.</p>
<p>And when that &ldquo;delicious home-cured ham&rdquo;
that Bumpus had spoken of, and which had really
come from his own house, so that he knew what he
was saying when thus describing it, began to turn
a rich brown in the pair of generous frying-pans,
giving out a most appetizing odor; together with
the coffee that Bumpus himself had kept charge of,
well, the healthy boy who could keep from counting
the minutes until summoned to that glorious feast
would have been a strange combination.</p>
<p>Bumpus was trying a new way with his coffee.
Heretofore he had simply placed it in the cold
water, and brought this to a boil, keeping it going
for five minutes or more. Now he had the water
boiling, and just poured in the coffee, previously
wetted, and with an egg broken into the same; after
which he gave it about a minute to boil, then let it
steep alongside the fire for the rest of the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better than anything we ever had, isn&rsquo;t it, fellows?&rdquo;
he demanded, after he had tested the contents
of his big tin cup, and nearly scalded his mouth
in his eagerness. &ldquo;Ketch me going back to the old
way again. Coffee boiled is coffee spoiled, I read
in our cook book at home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>It was good, but all the same Giraffe, as well as
several others, declared they preferred the old way,
because it was such fun to see if the cook was caught
napping, and allowed the pot to boil over; besides,
the aroma as it sent out clouds of steam was worth
a whole lot to hungry lads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bumpus, I&rsquo;ve got a favor to ask you,&rdquo; said
Davy, as they started to settle down around the fire,
each in a picked position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, Davy, you know I&rsquo;m the most accommodating
fellow in the bunch. Tell me what
I can do for you,&rdquo; replied the fat scout, immediately;
and every word he spoke was actual truth,
too, as his comrades would have willingly testified
if put on the witness stand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d let me sit over there, and you take
my seat, which, I reckon is much more comfortable
than yours; and besides, you complained of a pain
in your back, and I&rsquo;m afraid of the chilly night wind
taking you there. You&rsquo;ll face it here instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you budge, Bumpus!&rdquo; exclaimed Giraffe;
&ldquo;he&rsquo;s only giving you a little taffy, don&rsquo;t you see?
Thinks he&rsquo;ll have a better chance to enjoy his grub
if the wind don&rsquo;t blow <i>from</i> you, to him. I
wouldn&rsquo;t stand for it, Bumpus; you just stay where
you are. Reckon you look comfortable enough, and
what&rsquo;s the use dodging all around?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! guess you&rsquo;re thinking of your own comfort
now, Giraffe,&rdquo; grunted Davy in disgust.</p>
<p>Bumpus eyed them both in distrust.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;I remember we learned in school that it was
best policy to keep an eye on the Greeks that come
bearing gifts,&rdquo; he wheezed; &ldquo;and so I&rsquo;ll just stay
where I am. If you don&rsquo;t like it, Davy, why,
there&rsquo;s plenty of space all around. As if I&rsquo;m to
blame because this old swamp isn&rsquo;t the sweetest
place agoing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation soon became animated and general,
so that the three disputants forgot the cause of
their trouble. Bumpus was the bugler of the troop,
and always insisted on carrying the silver-tongued
emblem of his office along with him; he had it by his
side now; but Thad had given peremptory orders
that he should not make any use of the instrument
except by special order; or under conditions that
might arise, whereby they would need to be called
together, like a scattered covey of &ldquo;pa&rsquo;tridges,&rdquo; as
quail are universally designated in the South.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must remember,&rdquo; Thad went on to say,
&ldquo;that this isn&rsquo;t just an ordinary jaunt, or an outing
for fun. It means a whole lot to me that I
manage to find the man and the little girl. Either
it will turn out to be Felix Jasper and my lost sister;
or else we&rsquo;ll prove that the gentleman was terribly
mistaken. And you can understand, fellows,
what a load I&rsquo;m laboring under all the time that
puzzle remains unsolved. But I want you to remember
that we ought to keep as quiet as we can.
Bumpus, you understand the situation, and why we
don&rsquo;t ask you to amuse us with some of your fine
songs?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Bumpus had a very good voice, and often did entertain
his chums while in camp by singing certain
songs they were particularly fond of. He was a
sensible fellow, and did not take offense easily.
Moreover, even though he might feel huffed over
some action on the part of his mates, he never &ldquo;let
the sun go down on his wrath,&rdquo; but was quick to
extend the olive branch of peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I understand, Thad!&rdquo; he declared; &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;m going to bottle up my voice on this occasion,
so&rsquo;s to have it in fine trim, to let loose in a hallelujah
when we find that it <i>is</i> your little sister Pauline&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus said no more, and for a very good reason;
because, just at that particular moment there
arose the strangest sort of sound from some point
close by, such as none of the scouts could ever remember
hearing before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small">SOME WOODS LORE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye call that, now?&rdquo; exclaimed Step
Hen.</p>
<p>Giraffe assumed a superior air, as he hastened
to remark:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next time you hear an old alligator bull bellow,
you&rsquo;ll recognize the same; but to tell the truth,
I&rsquo;m kind of disappointed, myself, because I expected
to get something bigger&rsquo;n that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it an alligator, Thad?&rdquo; demanded Davy;
while Bumpus was seen to involuntarily move a
little closer to the tree under which the camp-fire
had been made, and the twin, khaki-colored, waterproof
tents erected.</p>
<p>The scout-master shook his head in the negative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Giraffe&rsquo;s got another guess coming to him this
time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;From all I&rsquo;ve picked up, I reckon
we&rsquo;ll not be disappointed when we do hear some old
scaly bull bellow. But they tell me this happens
generally along toward dawn. And the sound is
more like the roaring of a lion, than what a regular
bull gives out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;But what was that we heard, then, Thad?&rdquo; persisted
Step Hen; for long ago these boys had taken
it for granted that a scout-master should be in the
nature of a &ldquo;walking encyclopedia,&rdquo; as Bumpus
called it, filled to the brim with general information
on every known topic, and ready and willing to
impart the same to the balance of the patrol on request;
and truth to tell they seldom caught Thad
Brewster in a hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, there are a lot of things in a Southern
swamp, any one of which might make a noise
like that. If you asked me my plain opinion I&rsquo;d
guess it might have been a wandering night heron,
which has a hoarse cry, some of you happen to
know, because we struck them up in Maine that
time we spent a vacation there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What other creatures are we likely to run across
here, besides snakes and alligators, runaway coons
and the like?&rdquo; pursued Davy, always wanting to
know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course there are muskrats, because you can
find them in every swamp east and west, north and
south,&rdquo; Giraffe ventured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, muskrats are found, though not so many
as in the north, and the skins are sometimes hardly
worth taking. But there are plenty of raccoons
and &rsquo;possums: and I&rsquo;m told they get quite some otter
down here, the most valuable pelt that comes up
from the South, selling at something like seven dollars
a skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! that&rsquo;s talking some,&rdquo; muttered the interested
Bumpus. &ldquo;Did I ever tell you fellows
that I once had a great notion of starting in to be
a trapper? Yes, I even read up a whole lot about
it, but kinder got twisted in the directions of how
to go about things, so as not to let the cunning little
varmints get the human odor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that there was a general laugh, causing the
fat scout to look around indignantly; whereupon the
others, notably Step Hen, Davy and Giraffe exchanged
winks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t that so, Thad?&rdquo; demanded Bumpus, turning
to the scout-master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right about that, Bumpus,&rdquo; came the
reply. &ldquo;Allan here, who has had lots of experience,
will tell you that the most successful trapper is the
man who manages somehow to keep from alarming
his intended game, both by making few if any tracks
around the place where he&rsquo;s put his trap; and by
eliminating the human odor that their sensitive
noses detect.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;There, didn&rsquo;t I tell you?&rdquo; demanded Bumpus,
triumphantly. &ldquo;Think you&rsquo;re smart to just sit
there and chuckle; but you&rsquo;ve all got heaps and
heaps to learn about the secrets of the woods. I
know my own weakness, and I&rsquo;m studying hard,
trying to remedy it. You&rsquo;d never guess what a lot
of cute things them pelt-takers have to put up, in
order to fool the woods folks; ain&rsquo;t that a fact,
Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus knew that so long as he could get the
scout-master to corroborate all of his statements he
was sure of having his opponents in a hole; and it
was amusing to see how he managed to accomplish
this same thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s all mighty interesting,&rdquo; Thad assured
them. &ldquo;Nowadays nearly every up-to-date trapper
makes use of a prepared scent which he places on
the trap, even if he baits the same. It is sold by
dealers in skins; and they say a trapper can get
much better results by using this, to attract the little
fur-bearing animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, Thad; you tell us they sell this
scent to trappers, or such as think they have a call
in that direction?&rdquo; demanded Giraffe, suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course any one can buy any quantity, if he&rsquo;s
got the price,&rdquo; Thad assured him. &ldquo;You seem interested,
Giraffe; perhaps, now, you&rsquo;re thinking of
embarking in the game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the lanky one only shook his head, and turning
on Bumpus he demanded severely:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;Looky here, Bumpus, did you, when you read
up about all these here interesting things connected
with trapping the fur-bearing animals of the wilderness,
ever go so far as to invest a dollar in buying
any of this wonderful stuff that they say is so fetching
that the silly little beasts just can&rsquo;t resist it?&rdquo;
and as he said this Giraffe tried to hold the fat boy
transfixed with his piercing gaze&mdash;some of them
had at one time even called Giraffe &ldquo;Old Eagle
Eye,&rdquo; earlier readers of these stories may remember.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t, if you want to know, Giraffe!&rdquo;
Bumpus broke out with; &ldquo;and I ain&rsquo;t agoing to tell
you any more about what I learned; because you&rsquo;re
all the time apicking on me, and accusing me of
things. I know I make mistakes sometimes, and
that one about not remembering whether I fetched
my mother back the medicine she wanted is abothering
me like everything right now; but the rest of you
are in the same boat, ain&rsquo;t you? Here was Giraffe
just a little while back awanting to rush after that
runaway convict, just as if we had lost anything like
that. Course it was a mistake and chances are we&rsquo;d
got in no end of trouble if he&rsquo;d had his way. Oh!
everybody blunders sometimes; to-day it may be
poor old Bumpus; but to-morrow one of the rest of
you is in the soup. Forget it, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about these swamp animals, Thad, or Allan;
and why do you say the skins don&rsquo;t bring as
good prices when they&rsquo;re taken down here, as in
the North?&rdquo; Step Hen wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t it stand to reason that the colder the
country the thicker the fur Nature gives to the animals
that bear it?&rdquo; asked Allan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, seems like that ought to be so; and
I guess that must be the reason Canada skins bring
the best prices of all,&rdquo; Giraffe admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes three times as much as ones taken
far South,&rdquo; Allan told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt that sooner or later we&rsquo;ll find
chances to examine the tracks of &rsquo;coons, &rsquo;possums,
foxes, muskrats, and even otter, while we&rsquo;re looking
around,&rdquo; Thad remarked; &ldquo;and it&rsquo;ll be interesting
to notice what difference there is between the various
animals, as well as between the same breed up
in Maine and down here in Louisiana; for they
grow smaller, as a rule, the further south you go.
A Florida deer can be toted back to camp on the
back of the average hunter, while one up in Michigan
or the Adirondacks would need two men and a
pole to carry it any distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This sure is mighty interesting,&rdquo; observed Step
Hen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always ready to soak in information
connected with the woods. I&rsquo;m like a big sponge,
you might say; ready to give it out again on being
squeezed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my part,&rdquo; Giraffe mentioned, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
seem able to get that coon out of my head; because,
if he was what we think, a hideout escaped convict,
chances are he must want a whole lot of things, from
a blanket, gun and clothes, to grub.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s unkind of you, Giraffe, to bother us with
such gloomy thoughts just as we are thinking of
soon going to bed,&rdquo; remarked Bumpus, uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s some horse sense in what he says,
don&rsquo;t you forget it, Bumpus,&rdquo; pursued Davy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fact,&rdquo; added Step Hen. &ldquo;Just put
yourself in his place for a while, and try to imagine
what your feelings&rsquo;d be like, asneaking around a
camp of boys, nearly half starved at the same time,
and scenting the good smells that fill the air all
around&mdash;of course I mean cooking meat, coffee and
the like. Say, wouldn&rsquo;t it nearly set you crazy; and
honest now, Bumpus, don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;d take
some risks to try and hook what you wanted so
bad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus, upon being thus deliberately appealed to,
nodded his head in the affirmative, and remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure would, and that&rsquo;s a fact, fellows. Then
you kinder look for a visitor in camp to-night, do
you? And that means everybody&rsquo;s just got to sit up
and stand guard, don&rsquo;t it? all right, you&rsquo;ll find me as
willing and ready as ever to sacrifice my comfort
for the public welfare. I&rsquo;m always there with the
goods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear! hear! Bumpus, we all know you like a
book!&rdquo; declared Step Hen, pretending to clap his
hands in enthusiasm, though no sound resulted from
the action.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and if the will was father to the deed,
there&rsquo;d be nothing left undone while Bumpus was
around; for he&rsquo;s always ready to try his best,&rdquo; Allan
went on to say, while the object of all this
praise turned rosy red with embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe you&rsquo;re only joshing me, boys,&rdquo; he remarked
uneasily, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m taking it for granted
that you mean all you say, and believe me, I&rsquo;m grateful.
If I wasn&rsquo;t so full of supper I&rsquo;d get on my feet,
put my hand on my stomach this way, and make you
the best bow I knew how. Like a lot more of things
you&rsquo;ll have to take the intention for the deed there,
too. It&rsquo;s a case of the spirit being willing, but the
flesh weak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Giraffe, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that there
was anything weak about you, Bumpus; but never
mind starting an argument about it now. We&rsquo;ll
just arrange things so that two scouts are on duty
all the time through the night. How would that
suit you, Mr. Scout-master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just about right,&rdquo; replied Thad; &ldquo;because we
are now eight, all told, and that would allow us to divide
up into four watches. And as Bumpus is so
anxious to do his whole duty by the camp, I&rsquo;ll promise
to take him on as my side partner when my turn
comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; mused Giraffe, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s mighty nice to have
a fellow along who isn&rsquo;t afraid of anything, and
will even make a martyr of himself in order to keep
peace in the camp.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;raps you wouldn&rsquo;t mind explaining just what
you mean by that, Giraffe?&rdquo; the stout scout quickly
remarked, suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you&rsquo;re as touchy as wildfire, to-night, Bumpus,&rdquo;
retorted the other, with a chuckle, as though
he felt that he had attained his object, which was
to excite the curiosity of the fat boy. &ldquo;Just turn
your mind on what may happen while we sleep, and
you&rsquo;ll be happier. But here&rsquo;s hoping that breeze
keeps acoming from that same quarter all the night,
because then we can plan better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davy snickered audibly at this, but Bumpus assumed
a lofty air, and would not pay any further
attention to those who were evidently bent on badgering
him.</p>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small">BUMPUS ON GUARD.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;How will we pair off for the tents?&rdquo; asked
Bob White, presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would be just as well to keep the
formation we already have in the boats,&rdquo; the scoutmaster
immediately replied, as though he might
have already figured this out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Davy Jones was heard to give a disappointed
grunt, though just why he should be the only one
to do so must remain a mystery; but at any rate
Bumpus refused to let himself show that he took it
as personally directed toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means Giraffe, Bob White and Smithy
sleep in Number Two along with me, does it, Mr.
Scout-master?&rdquo; Allan inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and let Smithy pair off with you, while
Bob White and Giraffe are pards on guard. I&rsquo;ll
take the first stage, with Bumpus, because that&rsquo;ll let
him have a longer uninterrupted sleep, and he&rsquo;s
more apt to stay awake in the earlier part of the
night than later on. When the time is up we&rsquo;ll
arouse Giraffe, who&rsquo;ll take charge of his watch.
That&rsquo;s understood, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of them declared it was very simple; and
that surely a spell of less than two hours could not
turn out to be a very hard task. Even Bumpus was
apparently grimly resolved to show his mates that
he had &ldquo;reformed,&rdquo; and would never, never again
be guilty of such a crime as going to sleep while
playing the part of sentry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got me so worked up atalking all about
that black escaped jail bird,&rdquo; he stoutly affirmed,
&ldquo;that chances are my eyes won&rsquo;t go shut the whole
night long. You see, I&rsquo;m sensitive by nature, and
when I hear dreadful things, like that poor fellow
nearly starving while he&rsquo;s hiding out in the swamp,
with the dogs trying to get on his trail all the time,
it makes my flesh creep. So please, Giraffe, don&rsquo;t
say anything more about it. You get on my
nerves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! that ain&rsquo;t a circumstance to some
things&mdash;&rdquo; began the tall scout; and then as though
suddenly thinking better of it, he cut his sentence off
short, so that no one ever knew what he had meant
to say, though there was Davy chuckling again, just
as if he might have a strong suspicion.</p>
<p>They had soon arranged their blankets in the two
dun-colored tents. The canvas had been prepared
by tanning in some manner, so that its former
white hue was altered; and at the same time it had
been rendered impregnable to water. This is a fine
thing about these prepared tents; because the ordinary
covering, while it is capable of shedding rain
for some time, once it gets soaked, if you simply
touch it on the inside with your finger, you are apt
to start a dripping that nothing can stop as long as
the rain comes down.</p>
<p>Giraffe, who was very angular, and always complained
of feeling every little pebble or root under
his blanket, when out camping, at once started to
gather some of the hanging Spanish moss, to &ldquo;pad
his bed with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They tell me it makes fine mattresses, after it&rsquo;s
dried,&rdquo; he remarked; &ldquo;so p&rsquo;raps it&rsquo;ll keep me from
wearing a hole in my skin while I rest here. Say,
it&rsquo;s simply great, let me tell you,&rdquo; he added, as he
sank down to test his puffy couch, &ldquo;so I&rsquo;d advise
every one of you to get busy, and lay in a supply.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;How about insects of all kinds, from red bugs
to ticks?&rdquo; asked Step Hen, who already had a few
fiery spots on his lower limbs, marking the places
where some of the former invisible guests had buried
themselves, and started to create an intolerable
itching and burning that made him scratch frequently,
without much alleviation of the trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! who cares about such small pests as them?&rdquo;
remarked Giraffe, loftily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much danger, if you select clean moss, Step
Hen,&rdquo; Thad told him; and as the scout-master was
himself following the example set by the inventive
Giraffe, of course all the others copied after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Misery likes company, they say,&rdquo; Step Hen
was heard to mutter; &ldquo;and p&rsquo;raps now to-morrow
there&rsquo;ll be the greatest old scratching bee you ever
did see. As I&rsquo;m in for it anyway, guess I&rsquo;ll take
the chances of mixin&rsquo; the breed,&rdquo; with which he
flung prudence to the winds, and started making a
collection for himself.</p>
<p>Now, Thad did not mean to neglect any precaution
looking to making sure that if a visitor came
to the camp during the night, in the shape of a
human black thief, he would find it difficult to carry
off any of their possessions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>First of all, he paid particular attention to the
boats, the paddles of which he himself carried into
the middle of the camp, and finally hid away in the
tents, so that they could not easily be run across.</p>
<p>Then he had some of the boys assist him, while he
ran the two canoes far up on the shore. Even then
he secured the painters in such fashion that any
one would have great difficulty in unfastening the
same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think that would make us feel secure
about our boats, Thad?&rdquo; Allan remarked, after all
this had been carried out with scrupulous care; for
the scout-master believed that what was worth doing
at all was worth doing well, and he applied this
principle to his every-day life, often to his great
advantage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we know what&rsquo;s good for us we want to always
guard the boats above all things,&rdquo; Thad went
on to tell them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say so,&rdquo; Bumpus admitted; &ldquo;just think
what a nice pickle we&rsquo;d find ourselves in, fellows, if
we suddenly lost both boats while we were right in
the middle of the swamp. We could lose lots of
things better than them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bumpus,&rdquo; observed Giraffe, solemnly, &ldquo;you
never said truer words&mdash;we could; and there might
even be some things we&rsquo;d be <i>glad</i> to part with, but
which seem to hang on to us just everlastingly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Davy seemed amused at hearing the tall scout
say this; but Bumpus either mistook it for a compliment,
or else chose to act as if he did; for he
grinned, and nodded, and wandered back to the
tents to get his gun; for Thad had selected the first
watch for himself and his partner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just show &rsquo;em that I can stay awake these
days,&rdquo; he was saying to himself in his positive way.
&ldquo;Time may have been when I was just a little mite
weak that way; but I&rsquo;ve reformed, so I have. Huh!
what&rsquo;s two hours to me, I&rsquo;d like to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the other scouts might, had they chosen,
have recalled numerous instances where Bumpus,
being set on guard, had later on been found &ldquo;dead
to the world,&rdquo; committing the most heinous crime
known to soldiers in war-time, that of sleeping on
post, and thus putting the whole army in peril.</p>
<p>When one fellow started to crawl inside the tent
others followed his example, until only Thad and
Bumpus remained. The fat scout had to take a
firm grip on himself, when he saw them going to
their inviting blankets, buoyed up so temptingly by
those armfuls of soft gray moss; but he proved
equal to the test, for he shouldered his gun, and
bade Thad station him in his place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to stay right here, Bumpus,&rdquo; the
other told him. &ldquo;I know it isn&rsquo;t the most inviting
spot going, for the ground is wet, and you can
hardly find a place to stand on; but those things are
good for a sentry, because they help keep him awake.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! never mind about me, Thad; I&rsquo;ll prove true
blue every time. But where will you hold forth?
I ought to know, so I could find you, in case anything
suspicious came along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Thad pointed out where he expected to stay,
and then went on to warn the other once more:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be very careful about using your gun, Bumpus,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I will, sure, Thad,&rdquo; declared the fat scout,
hastily. &ldquo;I hope now you don&rsquo;t think I want to
have any poor fellow&rsquo;s blood on my hands, do you?
I ain&rsquo;t half so ferocious as Giraffe, now. You
heard what he said about thinking the coon&rsquo;d get
what he deserved, if he came aprowling around here
in the night, and somebody filled him chuck full of
shot? I don&rsquo;t look at it that way. Fact is, I&rsquo;m
sorry for the poor wretch; and I&rsquo;d share my dinner
with him, if I had a chance, laugh at me for a
silly if you want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t hear me laughing at all, Bumpus,&rdquo;
Thad told him; &ldquo;and I understand just how
you feel about it. Nature gave you a tender heart,
and made Giraffe on different lines; but I tell you
plainly, I&rsquo;ve often wished some of the other fellows
were more like Cornelius Hawtree!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! have you, Thad?&rdquo; said the fat boy, with a
suspicious tremor in his voice. &ldquo;Thank you, thank
you ever so much for saying that. I&rsquo;d rather have
your good opinion, than that of any other fellow I
ever knew.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>And somehow he felt so light-hearted after receiving
that little sincere compliment from the
watchful scout-master, that he really found no great
difficulty in keeping wide-awake during the entire
term of his vigil; for there is nothing equal to a
little praise to set a boy thinking, and therefore remaining
vigilant.</p>
<p>When the time came to make a change he spoke
to Thad as soon as the other drew near his position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never batted an eye once, Thad, and that&rsquo;s a
fact,&rdquo; he announced, proudly. &ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m on the
road to better things, I tell you. And while I
heard lots of queer old grunting and groaning deep
in the swamp, I didn&rsquo;t see a suspicious thing. Will
you get Giraffe and Bob White out now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, because they come tailing after us, according
to the programme;&rdquo; and while Thad crept
into the second tent to arouse the boys, Bumpus
hung around so as to inform Giraffe that he had
fulfilled his duties as sentry to the letter.</p>
<p>However, the tall scout seemed to want to hurry
past him, and only gave a grunt in reply when
Bumpus launched forth on an elaborate account of
how he had proved himself equal to the test. In
fact, one might have thought that Giraffe was holding
his breath as though he feared to take cold by
breathing the cool night air too suddenly, after coming
out from his snug blanket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>When Thad and Bumpus had also crawled under
the flap of the first tent, all immediately became
quiet again, the new sentries having taken up their
positions as marked out by the patrol leader, in
whose hands such things must lie, as he is always
in charge of the camp.</p>
<p>Bumpus heard a little restless moving about
when he tried to settle down, as if at least one of
the other occupants of the tent might be trying to
change his position. But the fat scout was too
tired and sleepy to bother his head about any trifle
like this; besides his cold seemed to get no better,
and he was apt to give a loud sneeze at any time.</p>
<p>He distinctly remembered allowing his head to
drop on the rude pillow he had fashioned out of
his shoes, covered with his clothes-bag; and then
seemed to be carried away on the wings of dreams.</p>
<p>His waking up was very sudden, for it seemed to
Bumpus that a cannon had been discharged close to
his ears, after which came all sorts of loud calling.</p>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small">THE NIGHT PROWLER.</span></h2>
<p>When the alarmed Bumpus came crawling hastily
out of the tent, he trailed after the other three
who had been sleeping near him; for of course, not
being forced to carry such a weight around with
them as fortune decreed the fat scout should possess,
Thad, Step Hen and Davy Jones were much more
spry in their movements.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>Bumpus found a scene of more or less excitement
when he reached the open air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I did shoot the thief, Thad, because
I heard him kicking and grunting over there in the
bushes,&rdquo; Giraffe was crying, in excited tones; and
no doubt he was shivering all over at the very
thought of having done such a thing as fire directly
at a human being.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was he doing at the time?&rdquo; demanded the
scout-master, who did not altogether like the idea
of hearing what the sentry declared was the truth;
for his little talk with Bumpus told how Thad felt
about the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just sneaking right into the camp!&rdquo; declared
Giraffe, who seemed to feel that his act might need
bolstering up the best he knew how. &ldquo;Why, from
his actions I just made up my mind the ferocious
convict was bent on murdering the lot of us in our
sleep, and getting away with everything we had.
I tell you it served him right, Thad, and you must
know it. I tried to hit him in the leg; but the light
was that uncertain a fellow couldn&rsquo;t just make sure.
I hope myself I haven&rsquo;t done any worse than give
him a wound, which you can bandage up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already it seemed, Giraffe&rsquo;s bold heart was failing
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to see about it,&rdquo; said Allan, who,
when there was any unpleasant duty to be performed,
never allowed himself to shirk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Giraffe, show us where you think he keeled
over,&rdquo; demanded Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, over there where you see them bushes
waving in the night wind, whenever the fire picks
up. I&rsquo;ll foller after you, as soon as I can; I&rsquo;m
afraid I sorter sprained my ankle turning so sudden-like
after I shot, and it hurts like anything,
let me tell you. Go ahead, Thad, and take a light
along. If you haven&rsquo;t got that handy little electric
torch, why, just snatch up a stick from the fire.
And look out everybody, that he ain&rsquo;t playing possum,
and meaning to shoot when you come close
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course Thad understood. It was not that
Giraffe was growing timid, for he had always been
accounted the boldest of the boys in the Silver Fox
Patrol; but a sudden sickening realization that by
his incautious shot he may have taken a human
life, however worthless, made him feel weak about
the knees; that talk of a possible sprain of his ankle
was a pure fabrication to cover his hesitation about,
looking on his work.</p>
<p>Thad, however, would not hold back on that account.
If there was a wretched human outcast
lying there in pain, the quicker they found this out
the better, because, as scouts they had a plain duty
to perform.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>So Thad sprang over to the smouldering fire. As
Giraffe had said, the flames occasionally leaped up
as they found new places to eat into the brands; and
quickly selecting a promising torch he waved it
several times around his head until he had coaxed
it to flame forth, when he led the way in the quarter
mentioned by Giraffe.</p>
<p>The latter came limping after, no doubt all of a
quiver as to what he would hear said in another
minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is now, lying over yonder!&rdquo; suddenly
gasped Step Hen, pointing; and Bumpus
gripped his gun nervously as he tried to crane his
fat neck in order to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is something lying there!&rdquo; announced
Allan; &ldquo;and I saw it move just a little
then, so I reckon that it&rsquo;s pretty nearly gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that would be tough on the poor critter!&rdquo;
said Bumpus, sympathizingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and on our chum Giraffe!&rdquo; echoed Davy,
with something about his voice as though he meant
to imply that he would not envy the one who had
been so hasty about firing at an intruder.</p>
<p>Thad kept right on advancing, and suddenly he
was heard to give a queer little hysterical laugh of
relief; which proved that the scout-master must
have also been laboring under quite a strain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up, Giraffe!&rdquo; he called out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t he dead, then?&rdquo; cried the tall scout, forgetting
to limp any longer as he started to hurry
toward the spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I guess he&rsquo;s a goner, as far as that goes,&rdquo;
Thad went on to say; &ldquo;but it isn&rsquo;t a man after all,
only a runt of a razorback pig!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what d&rsquo;ye think about that, now?&rdquo; remarked
Smithy, as they gathered about the dun-colored
victim of Giraffe&rsquo;s deadly shot; and which
had evidently given its last kick, for it was stiffening
out even then.</p>
<p>Giraffe was heard to draw several long breaths.
He could not say a word at first, emotion so nearly
overcame him; but then Thad was glad this had
taken place, because he believed it might teach the
impulsive one a much needed lesson. Already had
Giraffe learned that he had a heart, which was not
so callous as he made out. And he would hardly
be apt to pull trigger so quickly at another time,
when there seemed to be a good chance that it might
be a fellow human being at whom his bullet, or load
of shot, was to be sent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I heard a grunting when I shot,&rdquo; he
finally admitted; &ldquo;but there were all sorts of sounds
breaking out around me. And then you fellows
started to yelp like everything, so no wonder I got
mixed up some. But see here, Thad, this porker
belongs to somebody, don&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly must have, when he was alive,&rdquo;
answered the other, with a smile; &ldquo;and if we can
ever learn who his owner was, we&rsquo;ll be only too glad
to settle the bill with him. That may prove to be
a dear snap shot you took, Giraffe; because of course
the cracker will put a high valuation on his property.
They always do when a train kills a cow on
the track.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it would be a shame to waste such juicy
meat, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; pursued the lanky scout, insinuatingly,
as he made his jaws move in a way that
carried out the idea of feasting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, it isn&rsquo;t going to be wasted,&rdquo; said
Thad. &ldquo;If we get the name we&rsquo;re bound to have
the game, too. So hang up your victim by the hind
legs, Giraffe, and in the morning we&rsquo;ll see that we
get two fresh hams, some shoulders, and spare ribs
in the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yum! yum! how&rsquo;s that for high? Nut-fed pork
for me every time, fellows. Haven&rsquo;t I read heaps
about the same being so fine down in Old Virginia.
Here, give me a hand, will you, Bumpus&mdash;no,
never mind, one of the others will do as well.
Smithy, you take hold, because you&rsquo;re nearly as tall
as I am; and we&rsquo;ll tie the pig&rsquo;s hind legs together,
so he can hang nicely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was soon accomplished, and all of the scouts
felt that the adventure, though giving them something
of a shock at first, was not fated to be without
its compensating features.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Once more those whose privilege it was to be
occupying the twin tents while their comrades remained
on guard without, again sought their blankets,
and the soft couches fashioned from the yielding
gray Spanish moss.</p>
<p>Giraffe, had, however, so far yielded to the dictates
of his better nature to say to Thad before the
scout-master crept out of sight:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to tell you that I&rsquo;m awful glad that was
only a shoat of a razorback instead of a poor black
coon,&rdquo; which was as good as admitting that he had
learned his lesson, and would be much more careful
after that how he pulled trigger when he did not
exactly know what species of intruder had invaded
the camp.</p>
<p>Thad was more than satisfied with the result.
He believed that he would not mind being given a
frequent shock, if by its means the rest of the boys
under his charge might see their way clear to better
things.</p>
<p>At the proper time Giraffe came and woke up
Step Hen and Davy, who were to take a turn outside.
The latter was heard to express himself the
very first thing he crawled beyond the flap of the
tent that &ldquo;the night air was quite cool, and likewise
very sweet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Morning came at last, and there had been no
further alarm; but for all that the boys were glad
when Thad called them forth, and said it was high
time they got breakfast started, as they had a long
day&rsquo;s work before them.</p>
<p>Giraffe begged that Allan cut up the dead pig;
and as the Maine boy had had considerable experience
along that line, he consented to act as butcher
for the occasion. Nothing would do the lanky scout
but that they must have some of the razorback in the
pan for breakfast, in the shape of chops, for he
could not wait until another whole day had passed
before tasting, to see if &ldquo;nut-fed&rdquo; pork was so
very fine after all.</p>
<p>Some of them said they thought it was &ldquo;peculiar,&rdquo;
others did not fancy it very much; but as
for Giraffe, he fairly raved over it; although Davy
hinted that he was just &ldquo;making believe,&rdquo; so that
he could come back three more times for the portions
of those who shook their heads, and said it
was a little too &ldquo;piggy&rdquo; for them.</p>
<p>Bumpus was strangely quiet this morning. He
could be seen frowning occasionally, as though his
thoughts might not be very pleasant; but then they
knew what a great fellow he was to worry over
small things; and they took it for granted that he
must be again trying to puzzle out the answer to
that mystery concerning the little package of medicine&mdash;whether
he had really delivered it to his
mother, or left it at some house on the way home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>No doubt he even pictured that mother as suffering
all sorts of agonies just because he had been so
careless; for he often declared it was going to be
a terrible lesson to him, and break him of some of
his bad habits.</p>
<p>But then he also eyed Giraffe and Davy suspiciously
whenever they came near him, as though he
rather expected to hear them once more make disparaging
remarks about the odors they claimed
came from the old and greasy suit he insisted on
wearing while in the swamp, instead of soiling his
brand new one; but they failed to do anything to
stir him up, from one reason or another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Thad beckoning to us to all come over,&rdquo;
said Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s found something or other, I warrant you,&rdquo;
Davy remarked; &ldquo;because I could see him nosing
around. Tracks, chances are ten to one, you mark
what I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For once Davy proved a true prophet, for as they
came up to where the young scout-master was
standing, Thad pointed to the ground, and then
went on to remark:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;When you fired that shot, and knocked over
the shoat, Giraffe, you builded better than you
knew. Look right here, and you&rsquo;ll see where a
man was crawling along on his hands and knees,
bent on entering our camp. He must have thought
you&rsquo;d taken a shot at him, for here&rsquo;s where he
whirled around behind this tree, and then made off
in a stooping posture as fast as he could move, always
trying to keep a clump of bushes between
himself and the camp. And the man your shot
scared off, Giraffe, was a barefooted escaped convict
too, as the signs seem to prove!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="small">THE HEART OF A SCOUT.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s interesting news, Thad!&rdquo; Step Hen
declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way you say that makes me think you
mean &lsquo;interesting, if true,&rsquo;&rdquo; Thad remarked, with
a little laugh. &ldquo;In other words, you want me to
prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! well, we&rsquo;re all such a lot of slow-witted
scouts that we have to be shown; just like we&rsquo;d come
from Missouri,&rdquo; admitted the other, in a tone that
was meant to serve as an apology.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m always ready to explain as far as I
can,&rdquo; the scout-master told him. &ldquo;At the same
time I have to keep an eye on Allan here, for you
all know that when it comes to reading the signs of
the woods I sit at his feet. What I pick up just
by figuring out, he knows from past experience.
So I want him to pull me in just as quick as he sees
I&rsquo;m on the wrong track; promise that, Allan.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; remarked the Maine boy, but his
manner told plainly enough that he was very little
afraid he would have to do anything of the kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Thad began, &ldquo;all of you can see by
the marks here that something was moving along
toward our camp; and if you look a little closer
you&rsquo;ll notice that it was a man on his hands and
knees; for here are the plain impressions of both
his hands; while his shuffling knees made that mark,
and that, and here is where his toes dragged along.
Plain enough, eh, fellows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As easy to read as A B C!&rdquo; declared Giraffe,
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another thing is that he had just reached this
spot behind the bushes at the time Giraffe let fly
with his gun, and then we all started to shout; for
you can see the tracks go no further. On the contrary,
the man became suddenly frightened, under
the belief that he had been discovered; for here he
scrambled to his feet, as you can plainly see each
impression of a bare foot, and as he hurried away
he kept back of the low bushes, from which I deduce
the idea that he must have stooped over in
order not to be seen and fired on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it goes right along like a book, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
said Bumpus, looking at the young scout-master in
admiration and wonder; for he could not imagine
how any one, and a mere boy at that, could discover
so much just from observation, and using his common
sense at the same time.</p>
<p>Allan nodded his head approvingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;But chances are that isn&rsquo;t near all you noticed,
Thad?&rdquo; he said, questioningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the other, promptly.
&ldquo;I can see from the signs that the man is barefooted,
and consequently in great need; so I am
compelled to believe that he must be an escaped
convict who has been trying to keep life in his
wretched body, perhaps for months, in this swamp,
eating roots or berries, trapping birds, or catching
fish, muskrats, turtles, anything that he can find.
And as nearly all those who are held in these camps
are blacks, I find it easy to guess that this is a
negro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t that a great way of finding out things,
though?&rdquo; marveled Bumpus. &ldquo;Why, Thad, you
talk just like you&rsquo;d been watching that poor old
chap every second of the time. I don&rsquo;t reckon,
now, that you could tell us anything else about
him&mdash;how big he was, and all that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a good-sized fellow, for you can see
that the track of his bare foot is really tremendous;
and if you look here you&rsquo;ll notice where he lay
flat on his face, so that it is possible to roughly
measure his length&mdash;all of six feet, too. And his
left hand is lacking one finger!&rdquo; added the scoutmaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; gasped Step Hen. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
only joshing us now, Thad; for how under the
sun could you tell such a thing as that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Allan chuckled, and looked immensely pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so!&rdquo; he was heard to mutter to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s the old story of keeping your eyes
about you,&rdquo; remarked Thad, &ldquo;and using your head
as you go. Three separate times, now, I saw where
he had placed his left hand spread out on the ground
where it was soft enough to take a pretty good impression;
and in every instance the <i>third</i> finger was
missing; so with all that proof I thought I was
safe in assuming that this man was marked. And
let me say, that later on when we get the chance
I mean to ask a lot of questions just to satisfy myself
about it. If a convict escaped from jail, or
some camp, who has no third finger on his left
hand I&rsquo;ll consider that I&rsquo;ve proved my case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the boys were still a little skeptical, and
asked to be shown those wonderful imprints of the
hand that told Thad such an interesting story; but
after they too had examined them they admitted
that it was even so.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;It sure beats the Dutch how these things stick
up with some fellows,&rdquo; Bumpus frankly admitted,
as he scratched his frowsy head in wonder, and almost
awe. &ldquo;Now, the rest of us looked right at
them impressions in the mud. We saw they&rsquo;d been
made by a human hand, of course, cause there ain&rsquo;t
any monkeys around here besides Davy; but not
one of us went any deeper. Why, after you&rsquo;ve
been shown, it stands out there like a mountain, and
you see it as plain as you see your nose when you
shut one eye. I wisht I could discover things that
way; there&rsquo;d be heaps of things I&rsquo;d find out, let me
tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Giraffe, severely, as he moved away
from the vicinity of Bumpus, his nose elevated at
an angle of forty-five degrees; &ldquo;but what we&rsquo;re
all hoping most for now is that you&rsquo;ll hurry and
get over that cold in your head, so that your natural
sense of smell will come back; for then you&rsquo;d certain
sure duck out of that grimy old suit that&rsquo;s just
greased from top to bottom, and give us a chance
to breathe the pure air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus looked at him pityingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do love to carry on a joke to the limit,
Giraffe,&rdquo; he said, simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joke?&rdquo; burst out the other in a vociferous
voice; &ldquo;let me tell you, this is a mighty serious
matter; and if it keeps along, some of us in desperation
may be tempted to jump on you while you
sleep, and make the change ourselves. We&rsquo;re getting
to a point where self-preservation is the first
law of Nature.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! who&rsquo;s afraid?&rdquo; retorted Bumpus, with a
shrug of his plump shoulders; &ldquo;but you want to
keep your hands off me, for I&rsquo;ll kick and bite like
fun if set on. I know you&rsquo;re just trying to see if
you can&rsquo;t convince me against my own good sense.
This atmosphere seems all right to me; though I
admit I don&rsquo;t just like the looks of this black swamp
water, and the ooze we meet up with sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe gave him a last piercing look; then as if
making up his mind that the case was utterly hopeless,
he shook his head and turned away; while
Bumpus went back to his camp duties as blithely as
though care sat lightly on his head.</p>
<p>After they had finished breakfast the tents were
struck, folded in as small a compass as possible,
and one stowed away in each of the boats. Afterwards
they cleaned up the camp, and made sure
that nothing worth while was left.</p>
<p>There had been certain portions of the razorback
that they did not mean to take along with
them. Seeing Bumpus busily engaged Thad approached,
asking:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you up to here, old fellow? Just as
I thought, trying to do a little favor for that wretch
of a three-fingered coon, by tying up this meat
where the animals will have a hard time getting at
it. Yes, you guessed right that time, for the chances
are he&rsquo;ll come back here as soon as he knows we&rsquo;ve
gone, in the hopes of picking up some scraps we&rsquo;ve
tossed aside. Bumpus, you&rsquo;re improving, because
that shows you figured it all out, and hit the bull&rsquo;s-eye
in the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fat scout looked immensely pleased to hear
Thad talk in this strain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, after eating such a jolly breakfast myself,
it struck me as pretty sad we should be so near
a miserable human being who was almost starved.
No matter if he is a bad man, and deserves all he&rsquo;s
getting, he&rsquo;s made like us, and I just reckon the
lot of us would be quite as tough as he is if we&rsquo;d
never had the benefit of a nice home and education
and full stomachs. And so I thought, as he&rsquo;d
be likely to come here, I&rsquo;d save these pieces from
the cats and skunks for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure does your big heart credit, Bumpus, and
that is the way a true scout ought to feel pretty
much all the time,&rdquo; Thad went on to say, looking
affectionately at his stout chum. &ldquo;Now, if he only
gets here soon enough, there&rsquo;ll be red ashes in the
bed of our fire, and he can start it up again, so as
to do his cooking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Bumpus, with a happy gurgle, &ldquo;I
thought all that out, too, Thad. See, here in this
paper is half of my matches. I can spare &rsquo;em easy
enough; and every one will be worth a heap to him,
I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that evidence of thoughtfulness Thad clapped
his hand on the shoulder of Bumpus, and as he
turned away remarked:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;They can talk about you all they please, Bumpus,
and make fun of the onion odor about your
old suit with more or less truth; but you&rsquo;re certainly
making better progress along the lines of
scout lore than most of the boys who think themselves
your superiors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that sort of earnest praise made Bumpus
beam with happiness all morning long.</p>
<p>The camp spot was deserted shortly after this
little talk between Bumpus and Thad. And for
some hours they continued to press slowly along,
following such channels as Thad believed to be most
promising.</p>
<p>All the time he kept in mind that they were trying
to come across a man and a girl who were supposed
to have a place of hiding somewhere in this
swamp; and so he considered this fact every time
he had to make any sort of choice concerning taking
one channel or another, invariably selecting
that which he fancied had been used more than
the other.</p>
<p>He had to decide from mute evidence. It might
be only a broken branch that told him a boat had
possibly scraped against a bush in making a short
turn; or the fact that he believed he could see a sort
of regular line of marked places, as though some
one besides themselves had resorted to the same
means of blazing their trail in order to be able to
go out whenever they felt inclined, without running
the danger of losing their way among all those
endless channels, and never being able to leave the
confines of that horrible swamp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>All this while it had been getting worse and
worse, the heavy growth enclosing them in a narrow
canal at times, so that they had serious doubts
as to whether they were doing the right thing, or
had wandered far from the proper channel.</p>
<p>It was while they were pushing steadily onward
that Bumpus, who was nodding as he lazily paddled,
suddenly heard Thad in the stern cry in thrilling
tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lookout, Bumpus, there&rsquo;s a water moccasin
just over your head on that limb, and acting like
he&rsquo;d drop in the boat. There! throw yourself back,
Bumpus, quick now, I tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="small">LOOKING BACKWARD.</span></h2>
<p>Now, if there was anything in the wide world
that could give the fat scout a real hard scare, it
had to do with snakes. Had he been told that
there was a yellow-eyed wildcat crouching on a
limb, and evidently planning to spring straight at
him, Bumpus might have exhibited a certain degree
of courage, and at least have tried to reach around
in search of his gun; but a hideous, squirming
snake was quite a different proposition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>And only that morning he had heard Thad tell
about how venomous these numerous water moccasins
were; how indeed, in some places, their bite
is feared only second to that of a rattler; for while
immediate death does not as a rule take place, often
the wound will turn into an open running sore, and
create no end of bother.</p>
<p>And so doubtless that brain of Bumpus&rsquo; instantly
sent a &ldquo;wireless&rdquo; to other parts of his body, giving
the alarm. Certain it is that at the very same
instant the squirming object flashed before his eyes,
falling in the boat directly ahead of Bumpus, who
was in the bow, he made one magnificent backward
splurge, his feet kicking violently every-which way,
as in imagination he felt the fangs of the intruder
fastened in his leg.</p>
<p>It was a sight never to be forgotten by those
other scouts; though had not the canoe been very
staunch the chances were that Bumpus in his frantic
zeal to part company with the moccasin must
have tipped the craft over, and deposited himself as
well as his three companions in the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>Even as he kept both legs working like the piston
rods of an engine Bumpus was letting out roars
that would have done credit to an angry bull.
He afterwards confessed that it seems to be the
one prominent feature in his mind that Thad had
told them to make all the splash and noise they could
if ever they were threatened by these contemptible
water moccasins, as that would frighten them away.
And as Giraffe afterwards avowed, the noise that
Bumpus created would have given his comrades the
one grand scare of their lives, had they not known
the origin of it all. Bumpus actually took that as
a compliment, too, mind you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep still, Bumpus, or you&rsquo;ll upset the boat!&rdquo;
shouted Thad, sternly; and he had to exert himself
to be heard above all the row.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re safe enough, silly; he won&rsquo;t jump at
you!&rdquo; cried Davy Jones, who had all he could manage
with the head of the fat scout in his lap, and
those legs going like the arms of a windmill in a
stiff gale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gimme just one chance to whack the beggar!&rdquo;
demanded Step Hen, who had managed to pick up
the push pole, which was carried in case they became
fast in the mud at any time, and must depend
on brawn and muscle to get clear.</p>
<p>As the result of all these objurgations Bumpus
recovered enough sense to slightly raise his head,
so that he could take a peep. He discovered that
the moccasin had coiled in the very bow, and was
acting as though intending to retain possession of
the canoe; for it kept thrusting venomously with
its head, and showed a nasty disposition in the way
it opened its mouth.</p>
<p>But Step Hen poised the push pole as though
he meant business.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;Duck your head, Bumpus!&rdquo; he called out; at
which the other hastened to obey, not in the least
inclined to feel the heft of that stout pole.</p>
<p>He heard a crash, and gave a yelp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! that was my left foot you hit! Quit
knocking me!&rdquo; was his plaint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you wouldn&rsquo;t give me enough room!&rdquo; declared
Step Hen, complacently; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s all right,
Bumpus, you suffered in a good cause, and that
ought to repay you. I got him, and he isn&rsquo;t agoing
to jab you this trip, mark my words!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Bumpus, despite his pain, raised his head again
far enough to see that Step Hen had indeed settled
the snake; for it was wriggling aimlessly this way
and that, trying to strike even in its death throes,
such was its venomous nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toss it overboard, Step Hen!&rdquo; ordered the
scout-master.</p>
<p>Managing to get the point of the pole under its
folds, the other hastened to do so, and the struggling
reptile floated off, much to the relief of all those
who had been menaced, especially poor Bumpus,
who was nursing his toes, and grumbling that he
had &ldquo;to pay the fiddler even if he didn&rsquo;t dance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope now that pesky thing didn&rsquo;t go and get
a bite at me unbeknown,&rdquo; he said, as though a new
feeling of alarm had suddenly taken possession of
him; and though the rest laughed at the idea, nothing
would ease the mind of the stout boy until he
had taken off his leggings and closely examined
both shins; when he felt relieved of his anxiety.</p>
<p>Of course the talk among the boys for some time
afterwards was in connection with these dangers
that are ever present in Southern waters, especially
those of the swamps.</p>
<p>And again Thad cautioned them to beware how
they allowed a moccasin to become in any way
familiar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon,&rdquo; remarked Step Hen, after listening
to these warnings, &ldquo;that there ain&rsquo;t any place agoing
where the watchwords of Boy Scouts come in
better&rsquo;n they do down here; because, seems to me
a fellow&rsquo;s got to &lsquo;be prepared&rsquo; about all the time.
What with hungry alligators ready to make a meal
off your feet; poisonous snakes dropping off slanting
trees; bobcats waiting in the crotches above for
a chance to scratch you into ribbons; escaped convicts
atrying to steal about everything you own;
and so-forth, it wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad scheme to own
three pair of eyes and ears to keep on guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad was keeping up his watchful tactics of the
preceding afternoon as they thus slowly advanced
into the depths of Alligator Swamp. He did not
wish to make an error of judgment, if it could possibly
be avoided; for only too well did the boy
know from past experiences how such a mistake can
keep on swelling until the final consequences are
simply tremendous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>So they kept on marking each bend that they
turned, and Thad saw to it that he could pick up
one &ldquo;blaze,&rdquo; if it could be termed such, from another.
He also broke a smaller branch, always on
the side they came from; so that if in doubt later
on, it would be easy to make sure which way to
go, a very wise precaution indeed, and one that Allan
highly commended when he saw what was being
done.</p>
<p>They did not hurry, since nothing was to be
gained by making speed at the sacrifice of safety.
And as they thus journeyed, it was perhaps only
natural that, with the two canoes close together, one
of the scouts should ask Thad further questions in
connection with this man who had apparently taken
such a peculiar dislike to the Brewster family, in
that he could be suspected of having kidnapped the
little girl sister whom Thad remembered so well as
a baby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was only a small chap at the time, which was
nearly ten years ago,&rdquo; Thad told them, as a strange
look came over his young face, when thus recalling
the past; &ldquo;but I can remember him very well as a
dashing looking man, smart enough too, but with a
horrible temper, and some bad habits that finally
got him into trouble; for he took things belonging
to my folks, and was discharged from his position
as manager of the property.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;That downfall he seemed to foolishly lay at
the door of my mother, though to tell the truth she
was only too lenient with the rascal, who should
have been prosecuted, and sent to the penitentiary
for a term of years. Then, later on, my baby sister
strangely disappeared, and my mother never
fully recovered from the shock; because although
for some years she spent money like water, and
had the best detectives in the country searching
everywhere; but they never were able to find the
least trace of poor little Pauline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, sooner or later suspicion fell upon
this Felix Jasper, and as he was located in New
Orleans a close watch was kept upon his movements;
but they found no reason to cause his arrest;
and so it went until my poor mother finally
left me alone, and Daddy Brewster, a brother of
my father&rsquo;s, came and brought me to his home in
Cranford, where I met you fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which, I take it, was a red letter day for old
Cranford!&rdquo; declared Step Hen; &ldquo;because right
from the first you managed to inject more ginger
into the boys than they&rsquo;d ever known before. When
you went off that summer to visit some other relative,
and came back filled chuck full with Boy Scout
business, didn&rsquo;t you get every fellow in Cranford
excited, and wasn&rsquo;t the Silver Fox Patrol formed
as a result?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Davy, for the subject was one that
appealed to Thad&rsquo;s close chums very much, &ldquo;and
whenever we played baseball, or any other game,
wasn&rsquo;t it you who took the lead, and made the name
of Cranford respected through the whole county,
where before it had always stood close to the bottom
of the list? I should say we did strike it lucky
when you came along the pike, Thad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be enough for you, Davy; and suppose
we change the subject,&rdquo; remarked the scout-master;
although his eyes snapped, and his cheeks grew red
with pleasure to know that his comrades appreciated
him so much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you reckon you&rsquo;d ever be able to recognize
this man if you set eyes on him again, Thad?&rdquo;
asked Bumpus, at this juncture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure I would,&rdquo; came the positive reply;
&ldquo;because he couldn&rsquo;t have changed so much, only
to look older. I&rsquo;d never forget those snapping
black eyes, and the straight nose, as well as the firm
mouth. As I remember him, Felix wasn&rsquo;t as cruel
as he looked, but his temper often made him do
things that perhaps he was sorry for afterwards,
though he had a terribly stubborn disposition, and
once started on a thing would carry it through,
regardless of every consideration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear of him after he was in New
Orleans?&rdquo; asked Allan, from the other canoe close
by.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe he prospered there for several years,&rdquo;
said Thad; &ldquo;and then got into some sort of trouble.
This same gentleman who wrote Daddy lately,
used to keep him informed as to what Felix was
doing, because somehow my uncle always believed
that sooner or later something would be heard about
my little sister through that man. Then came this
letter stating that he had been seen near Alligator
Swamp, and a girl in his company who might be
some eleven years old; just what the age of Pauline
must be if she is alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when he was in New Orleans didn&rsquo;t he
have the girl with him?&rdquo; demanded Giraffe, who
was generally pretty keen when it came to asking
questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but then the chances were that he knew he
was being kept under observation, and that at the
time he was smart enough to have her at some other
place. He did marry while in the city, but there
were no children, and his wife left him, so we were
told by the one who had been employed to keep tabs
on the man, perhaps on account of his villainous
temper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you imagine that after he had to clear
out from the city and hide, because of some crime
he had done, this Felix Jasper may have gone and
gotten the little girl, so that he would have company
in his exile&mdash;is that it, Thad?&rdquo; questioned Smithy,
who had once known of a case something like that
of the other, and could sympathize with his chum.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m hoping, and what seemed to
strike Daddy as perhaps the truth,&rdquo; replied the
other. &ldquo;But if we have any decent kind of luck
I&rsquo;ll know more about it all before we start back
home to Cranford again; because I&rsquo;m determined to
comb this old swamp through and through, asking
every one I meet, to get pointers until I run across
the man who was seen with a little girl. And if it
turns out that after all he isn&rsquo;t Felix, I&rsquo;ll be feeling
pretty sick, let me tell you. But something seems
to keep telling me here,&rdquo; and he laid a trembling
hand in the region of his heart, &ldquo;that there&rsquo;s glorious
news waiting for me; and every night I lie
down I just pray with all my soul that it&rsquo;s going to
turn out that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do we all, Thad, don&rsquo;t we, fellows?&rdquo; exclaimed
Bumpus, soberly; and there was not one
among the other six but who instantly expressed
himself in the affirmative.</p>
<p>Thad quickly changed the subject, for he was
feeling very much excited and shaken because of
the sad memories recalled by his talk; and the other
scouts, realizing that he did not wish to continue
along those lines, readily fell in with his wishes
in the matter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>The morning passed, and all of them noticed that
it seemed to warm up greatly as the day advanced,
until they had stripped their coats off, and with
sleeves rolled up to their elbows as in the good old
summer-time up North, paddled along under the
arches of the closely growing trees. These were
cypress for the most part, since these seem to do
better in the midst of water than any other species;
and their expanded butts always several times as
large in girth as the trunks were five feet from the
roots, gave the boys no end of argument as to the
cause of such a strange growth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed Bumpus, &ldquo;that
was an alligator bellering, Thad, wasn&rsquo;t it? You
said they generally talked just before dawn, but
still one lonely fellow might happen to break the
rule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrong again, Bumpus, because that wasn&rsquo;t any
sort of animal or reptile,&rdquo; the scout-master went
on to say, with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t mean to tell me a <i>bird</i> could
grumble like that, Thad?&rdquo; continued the amazed
Bumpus.</p>
<p>The rest set up a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure have got snakes and &rsquo;gators on the
brain, Bumpus!&rdquo; declared Giraffe, scornfully.
&ldquo;Why, if you was up home right now, you&rsquo;d aguessed
like the rest of us did, that what you heard was the
grumble of thunder, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="small">&ldquo;COMBING&rdquo; THE SWAMP LABYRINTH.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you can&rsquo;t fool me that way, Giraffe!&rdquo;
chuckled Bumpus. &ldquo;I may look green, but things
ain&rsquo;t always what they seem. Thunder, eh? And
this is mighty near the end of December, too. Try
again, Giraffe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but don&rsquo;t forget, Bumpus, where you are,&rdquo;
cautioned Thad. &ldquo;This country in winter time
can have anything we expect only in summer up
North, and that stands for thunderstorms any
month in the year. There, that was a louder peal;
and now you&rsquo;ll understand we&rsquo;re not trying to make
you swallow a tough yarn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure did sound like it,&rdquo; admitted the fat
scout, &ldquo;but I never thought we&rsquo;d run up against a
thunderstorm, or I&rsquo;d have fetched my new raincoat
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness knows you did bring more than your
share, as it is,&rdquo; complained Step Hen. &ldquo;You ought
to have a boat all to yourself, because the rest of
us don&rsquo;t get a chance for our lives. But I say,
Thad, do we stand for a ducking?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I could see a chance to go ashore I&rsquo;d say
we might get the tents up, and hold over till the
storm had passed by,&rdquo; the scout-master replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s agoing to be hard,&rdquo; ventured
Giraffe; &ldquo;because right now there don&rsquo;t seem to
be a piece of ground as big as a postage stamp in
sight; nothing but the fat butts of these here old
cypresses, and low-hanging vines around. Reckon
we must just stand for wet jackets, boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, don&rsquo;t give it up so easily,&rdquo; said Thad.
&ldquo;Pull over to where those vines hang low, and see
if you can&rsquo;t manage to fasten your tent up in some
sort of style, so that it&rsquo;ll hang over the boat, and
keep the rain off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how about the wind, won&rsquo;t that blow her
every which way?&rdquo; asked Bob White.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find precious little wind with this rain,&rdquo;
Thad assured him, &ldquo;because it is so thick in the
swamp here that we&rsquo;ll be protected. You may
hear it humming in the cypress tops, but hardly a
ripple below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! that&rsquo;s the ticket, then!&rdquo; cried Bumpus,
who did dislike to get wet more than almost
anything; yet who often managed to stumble, and
fall into lakes and duck ponds in a way that was
most exasperating. &ldquo;Anyhow, if the worst does
come, I&rsquo;ve got my old duds on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we know you have, sure we do, Bumpus,&rdquo;
Davy made sure to call out, as his face took on an
expression of pain that made Giraffe laugh; for
just then the latter being in the other boat, was
separated from Thad&rsquo;s craft by a dozen yards of
water, and to windward at the same time.</p>
<p>It was found that the plan proposed by Thad
was possible of execution. Happily the vines came
down low enough for the boys to secure the tents
in such a way that they could be spread out, and
thus cover most all the boats&rsquo; surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is what I call a boss scheme,&rdquo; Giraffe was
heard to call out, from under the dun-colored canvas
that was wobbling violently, as the boys made
out to secure the ends the best they could, and in
this way hold the boats steady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever know Thad to think up one that
wasn&rsquo;t the best going?&rdquo; demanded Smithy; who
was really the latest recruit in the patrol, though
he had learned a great many things since joining,
and long ago ceased to merit the opprobrious title
of &ldquo;greenhorn&rdquo; or &ldquo;tenderfoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen! I think I hear the rain!&rdquo; called out
Thad, more to break in upon this flattering line of
talk than because it was necessary to draw attention
to the pattering of the drops upon the canvas covers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right; and I tell you we didn&rsquo;t get fixed
any too soon, fellows!&rdquo; Bumpus exclaimed, as he
snuggled down in comfort, holding on to his share
of the tent as though half expecting, despite the reassuring
words of Thad, to presently feel the same
violently torn from his clutch by the gale unless he
fastened to it with the tenacity of a bull terrier.</p>
<p>Inside of three minutes the rain was coming down
heavily, while the thunder proceeded to crash with
all the vim of a real summer storm up home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One good thing,&rdquo; declared Giraffe, between
outbursts, and when the rain seemed to let up a
little, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t have to depend on the walking
any; and after it&rsquo;s all over we can go right ahead
as well as ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe it&rsquo;ll raise the swamp level some,&rdquo; advanced
Step Hen, &ldquo;and we won&rsquo;t be apt to run on
the mud banks, like we did more&rsquo;n a few times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Getting lighter all the while, boys; and I guess
she&rsquo;ll soon quit!&rdquo; Giraffe went on to remark; and
they all agreed with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did anybody get wet?&rdquo; asked Allan, when it
seemed as though the storm had passed over, and
was rumbling away in the dim distance, having
gone to the northeast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nary a drop!&rdquo; Bumpus triumphantly declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! there might be fellows mean enough to
wish somebody <i>had</i> gone and got soaked through
and through; for then he&rsquo;d have to bring out his
new suit, and wear the same,&rdquo; Davy growled.</p>
<p>Bumpus was seen to be glaring suspiciously at
the speaker when the wet tent was taken down in
the most careful manner possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;I really believe you wouldn&rsquo;t care a red cent,
Davy Jones,&rdquo; he said, sternly, &ldquo;if I happened to
make a bad step, and walked overboard. Fact is,
I&rsquo;m agoing to keep my eye on you after this. Like
to have me get my old suit wet, would you, so I&rsquo;d
just <i>have</i> to make the change; well, I wouldn&rsquo;t put
it past you to give me a little shove, or trip me up,
so I&rsquo;d take a header. Better take care, because
there&rsquo;s a limit to my good nature. Some fellows
can be coaxed to do nearly anything, but they object
to being driven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to him talk, would you?&rdquo; cried Davy,
pretending to be hurt by the accusation of the other,
though there was a gleam in his eyes that told he
had been given an idea by Bumpus&rsquo; remark. &ldquo;You
make me think of the traveler that the sun and
the wind picked out as a victim, to see which was
the stronger. He had a cloak on, and the one that
managed to get it off was to be the victor. So the
wind tried as hard as anything, but the traveler only
wrapped his cloak tighter around him. Then the
sun got hotter&rsquo;n hotter, till he just couldn&rsquo;t hardly
breathe; so what does he do but throw away his
cloak; and of course the sun won, hands down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chestnut!&rdquo; gibed Giraffe, from the other boat;
&ldquo;ten to one even six suns couldn&rsquo;t force Bumpus
to shed his coat when once he&rsquo;d made up his mind
to keep it on. Just like that stubborn will of his,
it grows stronger and stronger all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Davy, &ldquo;and every little while you
can see him sitting by the fire, with his chin held in
his hand and a far-away look in his eyes; and then
you know he&rsquo;s cracking his poor brain trying to remember
what happened to that five cents&rsquo; worth of
medicine he can&rsquo;t remember what he did with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you again and again that the money
part don&rsquo;t enter into this matter at all?&rdquo; demanded
Bumpus. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just because I was so wretchedly
careless, that it keeps wearing on my mind. I
ought to know what I did with that stuff; and I&rsquo;m
bound to figure it out, or bust a boiler atrying.
Didn&rsquo;t Thad tell us that was a good trait in a scout?
Ain&rsquo;t being determined what every good scout ought
to try&rsquo;n practice? Didn&rsquo;t he tell us about how the
hungry wolf over in Siberia will set out on the
track of a deer in the snow, and keep everlastingly
after him, even if the chase seems silly to begin
with; but nearly every time he&rsquo;ll get his game before
he quits, just by his pertinacity. That&rsquo;s what
I am, one of the stick-at-it kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never said truer words, Bumpus!&rdquo; coughed
Davy, toward the stern of the boat, &ldquo;some things
are like a rolling snowball, they keep on getting
bigger&rsquo;n bigger the longer they exist. But every
dog has his day, and we live in hopes that something&rsquo;ll
happen to make you change your mind
about that same coat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>When the tents had been squeezed as dry as possible,
the forward progress was resumed, all of them
feeling rather light-hearted over the clever way in
which they had cheated the storm. It always gives
a boy a sense of superiority to feel that he has come
out first best in a battle with Nature.</p>
<p>Some of the scouts doubtless began to wonder
how they were ever going to locate the man and
the girl, deep in the gloomy recesses of Alligator
Swamp; but those who kept their wits about them,
and watched what Thad was doing, must have
ere this come to the conclusion that he had not
been wandering aimlessly about all this time, but
on the contrary had some definite plan of campaign
in view, which he kept constantly following.</p>
<p>In fact, Thad was on the alert for any sort of
sign that would tell him some other boat had been
in the habit of passing along through these channels.
Allan at times called his attention to certain
indications along those lines. And it was in the
hope that this other boat might be the one containing
the man and the girl, whose presence here had
drawn him from his faraway Northern home, that
Thad continued to pursue his set course.</p>
<p>As the afternoon began to wear away, after they
had partaken of a light cold lunch that was not at
all satisfactory to Giraffe, who declared at its close
he was nearly starved, all of them began to keep a
bright look-out for some decent sort of dry land
where they might camp for the coming night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Smithy, who liked plenty of
room, &ldquo;it would be manifestly next to impossible
for four fellows to stretch out comfortably in such
a narrow craft as this canoe,&rdquo;&mdash;Smithy always liked
to use big words, and was moreover very precise
in his mode of speech, but a pretty good fellow all
the same, a great change having come over him
since he took up being a scout, and ceased to cater
to his former &ldquo;sissy&rdquo; weaknesses along the line of
extreme &ldquo;dudishness,&rdquo; as Giraffe always called it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should say, yes,&rdquo; burst forth Davy
Jones; &ldquo;if you think you&rsquo;d have a bad time, just
cast your eye over this way and tell me what&rsquo;d become
of us, once Bumpus started stretching himself
out all over the boat. When he&rsquo;s sitting up it&rsquo;s bad
enough, but lying down would make the situation
er&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Intolerable, I suppose you mean, Davy,&rdquo; supplemented
Smithy, promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, in more ways than one it would be,&rdquo; declared
the Jones boy, darkly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; Bumpus told him, calmly;
&ldquo;because right now I guess Thad&rsquo;s got his eye on
a real nice camp site, if that grin on his face stands
for anything, and I think it does. How about it,
Mr. Scout-master; have you struck solid land?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see a place ahead that looks kind of good to
me,&rdquo; Thad replied; &ldquo;but because lots of things
don&rsquo;t happen to turn out as well as they promise,
we&rsquo;ll have to wait till we get there before we&rsquo;ll know
for sure. And as we&rsquo;re all tired of prowling around
in this way for one day, I think we&rsquo;ll hold up, providing
the chance comes along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even half a chance, Thad,&rdquo; urged Davy, hurriedly;
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t look a gift horse in the mouth.
Beggars shouldn&rsquo;t be choosers, my ma always says,
when I begin to hesitate about taking something
that&rsquo;s offered. Half a loaf&rsquo;s some better&rsquo;n no
bread. And as for me, I&rsquo;m fairly <i>wild</i> to get out
and stretch my weary limbs, and also mingle with
my other pards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Other pards, huh!&rdquo; sniffed Bumpus, who knew
very well that this was intended as another little
fling at him, though it failed to make even a dent in
his resolution not to give in to the requests of these
complaining fellows.</p>
<p>They were soon alongside the patch of high
ground discovered by Thad; and when they found
that it offered a splendid site for a dry camp, all of
them were pleased. The way they proceeded to
tumble out of the boats told that their limbs had
been more or less cramped by sitting so long, for
as many as seven hours had elapsed since they embarked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>In spite of the time that had been spent in pushing
along, they could not have made as great progress
as might be expected; for on numerous occasions
Thad was compelled to admit that he had
taken a false channel; after which they had to go
back over their course, destroying the marks that
had been left, so they might not later on mislead
them again, until a new start could be made.</p>
<p>First of all they jumped up and down on the
land, and performed all manner of gymnastic feats,
with the object of getting out the &ldquo;kinks,&rdquo; as
Giraffe explained it. Davy Jones was up a tree
like a flash, and swinging there as jauntily as any
Borneo gorilla could have done; in fact the Jones
boy never seemed so happy as when he could hang
with his head down, and his toes caught on a
branch. If he chanced to slip, he was as agile as
a cat, and would clutch some new hold. They say
that it is seldom a squirrel misses connections when
jumping from one tree to another; and surely no
boy ever came nearer to being a human squirrel
than did Davy Jones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, if you&rsquo;ve got limbered up enough,&rdquo; said
Thad presently, &ldquo;come and help me get the duffel
ashore, so we can look after the boats, as usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody was willing, and many hands make
light work, so the tents and all other things came
ashore at a lively rate.</p>
<p>Thad had just thrown down a package he had
been carrying, when he was seen to stand and look
down at it critically, and then shake his head, as
though trying to figure something out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;What ails you, Thad?&rdquo; called out Giraffe, who
happened to be near by, and noticed this queer action
on the part of the scout-master. &ldquo;I hope,
now, we haven&rsquo;t been and lost anything?&rdquo; for
Giraffe was always in fear lest the food supply be
cut short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but perhaps there&rsquo;s a chance we may,&rdquo; replied
the other, with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say; and what might it be?&rdquo; demanded
Davy, becoming interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, a sudden idea struck me, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; replied
Thad. &ldquo;To tell you the truth fellows, perhaps
you&rsquo;ve been treating our chum Bumpus shamefully
all the while, in accusing him as you have of
wearing clothes that are greasy and loud; because
I&rsquo;ve got a notion that I&rsquo;ve located the source of this
bad odor we&rsquo;ve been suffering from two whole days
and nights.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="small">WAS THE MYSTERY SOLVED?</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! joy! joy!&rdquo; cried Giraffe, upon hearing
this great news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thad, we all look on you as a public benefactor!&rdquo;
Bob White chipped in; though thus far he
had said very little about the annoyance the strange
odor was causing them; because he was a boy of
few words as a rule; and then again, he had not
been compelled to remain in the same boat, or sleep
under the same canvas as the scout on whose soiled
garments suspicion had fallen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;The best news I&rsquo;ve heard in many a long day!&rdquo;
declared Smithy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; was all Davy Jones gave utterance to,
but the word was uttered with what seemed to be almost
savage satisfaction; and his eyes at the time
were turned full on poor Bumpus, who of course
squirmed uneasily in his seat by the fire, where
he was fixing the coffee, and looked unhappy, as
well as anxious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please go on and tell us, Mr. Scout-master!&rdquo;
called out Step Hen; &ldquo;if this old stuffy cold in the
head I&rsquo;ve got from Bumpus has kept me from having
the pleasure of enjoying the mystery with you
all, I&rsquo;ve sure heard enough grunting and complaining
to excite my curiosity to the limit. What&rsquo;s the
answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gather around, then,&rdquo; said Thad; and they began
to form a circle; &ldquo;here, we want you too, Bumpus,
so leave your coffee-making, while you listen,
and give your vote; for if the majority decides I&rsquo;m
right, we won&rsquo;t be bothered any more with an unpleasant
neighbor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I hope you don&rsquo;t mean to kill him?&rdquo; remarked
Davy, pretending to shoot a glance of
brotherly commiseration in the direction of the fat
scout; &ldquo;or chase him out of the camp to herd by
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But somehow Bumpus had taken new courage
from what he heard Thad remark, and as he came
shuffling up with the rest, he was saying to himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! think you&rsquo;re smart, don&rsquo;t you, Davy
Jones, but just wait. Who&rsquo;s afraid, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All here, Thad!&rdquo; sang out Allan, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And waiting to hear the explanation of the mystery
that&rsquo;s been bothering the whole patrol&mdash;leastwise,
all but Bumpus and Step Hen, who ain&rsquo;t any
good just now at ferreting out things, because they
do nothing but blow, blow all day long,&rdquo; and Giraffe
loomed head and shoulders above the rest of
his mates as he faced Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to pass it along now, and I
want every one to take a good whiff, after which he
is to give his opinion whether this is the offending
package or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying this the scout-master picked up a stout
paper bag that had been lying at his feet, the top
tied with a string, and handed it solemnly to Giraffe,
who happened to be his next neighbor on the
right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our fine onions!&rdquo; gasped Step Hen, as he
recognized the shape of the bag.</p>
<p>Giraffe held the package up close to his nose, and
seemed to draw in a long breath, after which he
gave utterance to the one expressive word:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;Je<i>ru</i>salem!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say, Giraffe?&rdquo; demanded the patrol
leader, grimly, &ldquo;guilty or not guilty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elongated scout immediately wagged his
head vigorously in the affirmative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the same class of odor that&rsquo;s been bothering
us right along, Thad, sure it is; and I just
reckon you&rsquo;ve been and run our trouble down.
Them onions are getting old and soft, and everybody
knows how rank they are when that happens.
Whew! who&rsquo;s next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pass it along!&rdquo; demanded Bob White at his
right shoulder; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a good judge of onions, and
I&rsquo;ll soon settle this thing for you all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He too held the offending bag up near his nose;
it hardly needed words to tell what his verdict was,
for his face became screwed up in a manner that
could only stand for condemnation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Giraffe, I&rsquo;m with you!&rdquo; he observed, as he
hastened to give the bag to Smithy, next in line.</p>
<p>And so it went the rounds, even the grinning
Bumpus being allowed to have his chance at declaring
what he thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should say it <i>was</i> bad,&rdquo; the fat boy remarked,
as he held it close, and kept sniffing away
vigorously. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the stuff I don&rsquo;t wonder you
fellows kept kicking up such a row about it. But it
was mean to pick on me for nothing. I tell you
these old clothes ain&rsquo;t so <i>very</i> tough after all.
Maybe you&rsquo;ll get down on your ham-bones now, and
tell me how sorry you all are. Maybe you&rsquo;ll be
begging me to let you come back in the boat with
you, Giraffe; but don&rsquo;t bother, because I&rsquo;m agoing
to stick with Thad. He never took a mean advantage
of me like some or the rest did, just because
I&rsquo;m little and can&rsquo;t stand up for myself. Huh! who&rsquo;s
so smart now, tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe and Davy answered him not a word. No
doubt, just then they really felt humiliated, as though
conscience stricken, in that they had accused and
condemned poor Bumpus without a hearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s going to be done about it?&rdquo; asked
Smithy. &ldquo;We surely can&rsquo;t think of carrying those
offensive onions along with us any more, after all
the trouble they&rsquo;ve gone and made for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course not, they&rsquo;ve just got to go!&rdquo; declared
Davy, positively.</p>
<p>Giraffe looked unhappy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And me so fond of fried onions I always said
I&rsquo;d never be caught camping without some along,&rdquo;
he whimpered, mournfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re the one that made the biggest fuss
of the whole lot!&rdquo; cried Bumpus; &ldquo;why, you even
made <i>me</i> nervous, and I was afraid my fighting
blood would be worked up soon, if things kept on
like they were. Sure you couldn&rsquo;t vote to keep the
old things, after Thad&rsquo;s found out what they stand
for?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose not, boys,&rdquo; replied the tall scout, sadly;
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have to do without the appetizing onion after
this; but it&rsquo;s going to be hard on me. My appetite&rsquo;ll
fall away, and you&rsquo;ll see me getting thinner
and thinner every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can use you for a bread knife then,&rdquo;
remarked Bumpus, composedly; &ldquo;because if you
grew much sharper than you are, that&rsquo;s about the
only thing you&rsquo;d be good for. But if them onions
smell so rank, what&rsquo;s the use of throwing the same
away, when we&rsquo;ll be apt to know they&rsquo;re around all
night. They ought to be put underground, don&rsquo;t
you think, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea, Bumpus; give me the camp
hatchet, and I&rsquo;ll dig a grave over here, so we can
have a regular burial. Form in line, fellows, for
the ceremony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Entering into the spirit of the occasion the whole
eight scouts formed into a procession, and with
Thad in the lead, bearing the hatchet in one hand,
and the condemned bag of soft onions in the other,
held as far away from his nose as possible, they
started to walk solemnly along, heading for a spot
that the leader had picked out as suitable for the
ceremony of burial.</p>
<p>And as they thus stalked along the boys began to
chant in unison that old song: &ldquo;John Brown&rsquo;s body
lies amouldering in the grave, as we go marching
on!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>And so, with the hatchet a hole was speedily excavated,
and the offending object placed therein;
after which the earth was hastily scraped over, until
six inches of soil rested upon the bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, that&rsquo;s what I call a good job!&rdquo; remarked
Giraffe, with a relieved look on his face, as they
started back to where the fire burned merrily.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll seem like another world, now that we won&rsquo;t
have to keep sniffing around all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and saying all sorts of mean things about
my bully old suit that&rsquo;s stood by me through thick
and thin, until I&rsquo;ve just come to love the same!&rdquo;
Bumpus up and told the chief offender.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! well, let it go at that, Bumpus,&rdquo; muttered
the tall scout. &ldquo;A fellow is apt to get on the wrong
trail once in a while, you know; even Thad here
will do that same. We thought we was right, and
acted accordingly. And now we&rsquo;ll give you a
little rest, though we&rsquo;d all be glad if you did make
up your mind to change that greasy old suit for
your spic and span clean one. Guess you&rsquo;ll take a
notion that way some fine day, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! keep on guessing!&rdquo; grunted Bumpus;
though he appeared to be wearing a perpetual grin,
now that his innocence seemed to have been so
amply proven.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>After this little incident preparations for passing
the night were continued, the tents being raised, and
the fire encouraged to reach that stage where Giraffe
and his assistant might have all the red coals
needed in order to properly carry out the cooking
operations as usual.</p>
<p>Davy was wandering around, still eying Bumpus
suspiciously, as though not wholly satisfied in
his mind that all the trouble was over; but the fat
scout had been vindicated at the hands of Thad, so
what cared he if Davy chose to show his poor judgment,
when everybody else seemed satisfied.</p>
<p>Once Davy even wandered over to where the
burial of the onions had taken place, and with his
foot scraped even more soil over the spot, as though
he wanted to be doubly sure they had confined
everything in that hole.</p>
<p>When the supper was finally ready it was a merry
group that squatted around, for Giraffe always felt
particularly joyous when about to satisfy his acute
hunger, and on this particular occasion he believed
he had a double reason to rejoice, in that the food
supply was bounteous, and a baffling mystery had
been solved, so there would be no further reason for
his keeping awake nights, trying to guess the answer,
and making things unpleasant for poor Bumpus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>They chattered about nearly everything under
the sun, as they sat there munching away at the repast;
which consisted of breakfast bacon (as they
had come to term the real stuff, since plain salt
pork is called &ldquo;bacon&rdquo; in the South) fried potatoes,
with just one onion cut up in the same, to
give a flavor, and which Giraffe had saved from
the wreck before the explosion came; some toast
made from the last loaf of bread they had along;
cheese for those who liked it; some pork chops;
and last but not least, the usual coffee that did
not seem to keep anybody awake, though a number
were not in the habit of drinking it save at
breakfast when at home; but then lots of things are
done with impunity in camp that no one dares
think of when under his own roof-tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after this, sweet balmy sleep!&rdquo; said
Smithy, who was somewhat given to spouting
poetry, and showing a spirit of romance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Giraffe, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;re all of us tired
enough to enjoy a good eight hour snooze, unless
Thad wants us to keep watch and watch, which I
hope he won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I do hope,&rdquo; remarked Bumpus, sweetly,
&ldquo;that I&rsquo;ll be able to crawl into my bully old blanket
and hit the straw, without hearing any coarse remarks
about it&rsquo;s being time old suits of khaki that
have stood the wear of time were called in!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="small">ALLIGATOR SMITH, THE GUIDE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Thad?&rdquo; asked Allan,
some time later, while they were lounging around
the jolly camp-fire, and taking things easy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought I heard the splash of a paddle
just then, when it was all still!&rdquo; and the scout-master
continued to cock his head on one side, in the
act of straining his hearing, as though half expecting
to catch a repetition of the sound.</p>
<p>Every scout remained mute, and an anxious look
seemed to creep over not a few boyish faces; for
they had been told such strange stories about the
&ldquo;hideout&rdquo; people of Alligator Swamp that all
sorts of fancies had taken possession of their young
minds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, I do believe, Thad,&rdquo; muttered
Giraffe, who had splendid hearing, as well as wonderful
eyesight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you caught the splash that time, too?&rdquo;
questioned the scout-master.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure pop, and it wasn&rsquo;t the flap of a &rsquo;gator
dropping in from a bank, or the sportive play of a
muskrat, either. Nothing but a paddle would
make that noise; and as sure as you live I can see
the canoe acoming this way right now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This announcement created no end of excitement.
Every fellow thought it was up to him to
get in readiness to resist boarders, and when he
could not have a gun because there were not enough
to go around, at least a club, the camp hatchet, or
in an emergency the long bread-knife seemed to
offer some degree of comfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see him too!&rdquo; remarked Step Hen; and others
echoed the words; indeed it would have to be a
very dull fellow who could fail to distinguish the
moving object that was approaching so boldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t afraid, anyway!&rdquo; ventured Davy
Jones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more he ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; added Giraffe; &ldquo;which
would seem to give the idea that he didn&rsquo;t mean
us any harm; or else felt that one man was equal
to a whole patrol of Boy Scouts, which don&rsquo;t seem
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s got another guess coming if that&rsquo;s
so,&rdquo; muttered Bumpus, who, with his gun in hand
was not showing much alarm; for since he had
seven chums to back him up, the fat scout could not
see why he should tremble, save with excitement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is only one man in the boat,&rdquo; remarked
Thad, a little anxiously; &ldquo;and as he&rsquo;s coming about
over the course we did, I wonder now if it could be
any messenger sent after us by that telegraph agent
at the town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped Smithy.</p>
<p>Instantly every fellow felt a queer sensation pass
over him. The words uttered by Thad had conjured
up all sorts of grave possibilities as connected with
their various happy homes away up North; and
doubtless they suffered tortures from that moment
on.</p>
<p>Straight for the camp came the solitary paddler.
He was seated in a roomy boat built after the prevailing
type used around the neighborhood of the
swamp, and from the dexterity with which he
handled the paddle it was plain that he must be
quite at home on the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! boys, I&rsquo;m comin&rsquo; ashore tuh jine yuh!&rdquo;
he called out; perhaps being a little dubious as to
what sort of reception they were calculating on
giving him; for the display of guns and hatchets
and knives must have looked ominous indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, come along then!&rdquo; Thad sang out
in reply.</p>
<p>Two minutes later and the stranger&rsquo;s boat was
drawn up on the sloping bank, and he strode toward
the fire. Then the eager boys saw that he
had a genial if wrinkled, sun-burned face, and a
scraggy gray beard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Alligator Smith,&rdquo; he announced, just as
though that name might be known in all that section
well enough to explain everything; and it
was, too, for the reader may remember that it was
this very man whom Thad had once wished he
could come upon to try and engage him as a guide.</p>
<p>Here was luck with a capital L. Thad immediately
offered the other his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to meet up with you, Mr. Smith,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a namesake of yours with us, though
we call him plain Smithy; and this next Boy
Scout is Allan Hollister; the stout chap Bumpus
Hawtree,&rdquo; and so he went on, introducing each
chum, while the angular native proceeded to shake
hands with them in rotation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wanted to run across you, the worst kind,
sir, and so we call this a happy meeting,&rdquo; Smithy
remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s thet yuh say?&rdquo; asked the other, apparently
puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we had need of a good guide for poking
around in this swamp, and everybody seemed to
fight shy of the job; but they all said that if we
could only come on Alligator Smith, and he&rsquo;d engage
with us, we&rsquo;d be all lovely,&rdquo; Giraffe observed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s it, hey?&rdquo; the alligator hunter went
on to say, smiling broadly; &ldquo;why if so be yuh
wants me still, I ain&rsquo;t no &rsquo;jections tuh makin&rsquo; arrangements
lookin&rsquo; thataways, &rsquo;cause the &rsquo;gator
hide bizness ain&rsquo;t what it used tuh be; an&rsquo; money&rsquo;s
tight nowadays. But what under the sun be yuh
awantin&rsquo; tuh hunt around in this ole swamp fo&rsquo;,
boys? They ain&rsquo;t near so much game in hyah as
yuh cud find in the canebrake, or up on the high
ground. Ducks don&rsquo;t come in much, an&rsquo; yuh seldom
stir up a deer or a bar nowadays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plainly Alligator Smith had already had his curiosity
aroused. And so Thad believed that it would
be as well to tell him everything right in the start,
since he must know the facts so that he could serve
them to the best of his ability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t come down here just to hunt,&rdquo; he
started in to say, &ldquo;though we thought it best to
fetch a few guns along for an emergency. To
tell the main thing right in the start, we&rsquo;re looking
for a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I reckons as how I ketch on tuh that same,&rdquo;
observed the hunter, as he crossed his legs close to
the fire, and made himself quite at home, with the
scouts hovering around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a small girl!&rdquo; continued Thad, watching
the face of the other closely, so as to judge whether
any flash of intelligence would pass over it that
would serve as good news to the anxious lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! a gal too, yuh say? An&rsquo; d&rsquo;ye reckons as
how they be somewhar near Alligator Swamp?&rdquo;
asked the man, quickly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;A gentleman wrote my uncle that he had seen
this man and girl go into this swamp,&rdquo; Thad continued.
&ldquo;It may have been ten days ago. They
seemed to have a lot of provisions in the boat, as
though they were laying in a month&rsquo;s supply. He
had a gun, and looked ready to hold his own against
any runaway black convict he might happen to
meet. Do you know of any man and girl like that,
Mr. Smith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed as though every boy ceased to breathe
while waiting for the answer to come to this
important question which Thad had asked. The
swamp hunter nodded his tousled head slowly up
and down. He appeared to be thinking intensely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yas, &rsquo;twar about thet time I seen &rsquo;em,&rdquo;
he finally remarked. &ldquo;I &rsquo;member as how I&rsquo;d jest
got outen terbaccy, and nawthin&rsquo;d do but I must
make fo&rsquo; the village store tuh lay in a new s&rsquo;ply.
Yas, an&rsquo; I jest glimpsed thet boat as I kim outen a
side bayou. Reckoned as how&rsquo;t must be a stranger,
&rsquo;case I never seen the man afore as I knowed on.
I waved a hand at him, but he never made out tuh
notice. So I jest reckoned as how they must be
some new settlers as&rsquo;d took up a cabin I knowed
&rsquo;bout jest beyond the start o&rsquo; the swamp. Never
guv it another think, &rsquo;case I happened tuh hev
troubles o&rsquo; my own aplenty jest then, with my jaws
rusty from not havin&rsquo; any terbaccy fo&rsquo; nigh on two
days. So them be the pussons yuh want tuh find?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s no doubt about it, Mr. Smith,&rdquo;
replied Thad, his eyes shining brightly with renewed
hope; &ldquo;but do you really think they could
be so near the edge of the swamp? We came on
an old tumbled-down shack, with a mud and board
chimney, and a door hanging by one hinge; but
there wasn&rsquo;t a sign of life around it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I war mistaken when I reckoned thet
way, son,&rdquo; admitted the hunter; &ldquo;&rsquo;case that&rsquo;s the
on&rsquo;y cabin around in the swamp wuth mentionin&rsquo;
anyway. They must agone deeper in. P&rsquo;raps the
man air like some others as I knows &rsquo;bout, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t
want tuh meet up with a livin&rsquo; soul, so he&rsquo;s buried
hisself in thar sumwhar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s the man we think, his name is Felix
Jasper!&rdquo; Thad went on to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Jasper, d&rsquo;ye say? Well, now, thet&rsquo;s makin&rsquo;
me go away back sum. Yuh see, thar used tuh
be a fambly by thet name alivin&rsquo; &rsquo;round hyah yeahs
an&rsquo; yeahs ago; but the ole man he died and the rest
cleared out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then this might be one of the sons, mightn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; the boy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tuh be sure it mout, and which wud account
fo&rsquo; his knowin&rsquo; so much &rsquo;bout this hyah swamp;
&rsquo;case yuh see, it&rsquo;d be all a man&rsquo;s life was wuth tuh
come in and git lost among all these bewilderin&rsquo;
waterways. More&rsquo;n a few never kim out in yeahs
gone by; an&rsquo; them as hide hyah now knows every
crook and bayou like yuh do the fingers of yuh
hands.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you would be willing to stay by us, and
see us through, if we paid you the right sort of
price?&rdquo; Thad asked, determined to clinch the bargain
at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad tuh do thet same, son,&rdquo; replied Alligator
Smith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would three dollars a day and find suit
you?&rdquo; the scout-master went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; answered the other, readily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right then,&rdquo; Thad continued, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s call it
five dollars a day. And I hope there&rsquo;s nothing in
the way to prevent you sticking with us from now
on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, thet&rsquo;s what I calls handsome, an&rsquo; yuh kin
depend on Tom Smith astickin&rsquo; tuh yuh like a plaster.
We&rsquo;ll sure find the man, an&rsquo; theh gal, too,
if so be we hev tuh run through theh ole swamp
like a fine tooth comb. An&rsquo; I hopes as how they
turn out tuh be the same as yuh want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can understand how much I&rsquo;m hoping that
way, when I tell you that we think the girl may be
my little sister, who was stolen when she was a
baby,&rdquo; Thad went on to say; and upon the other
evincing great interest in the matter, he thought it
best to relate the whole story concerning the dismissal
of the estate manager on account of his evil
practices, and his subsequent hatred for the Brewsters,
which gradually led up to the mysterious disappearance
of little Pauline ten years ago, and the
inability of the best detectives in the country to find
her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Tom Smith was evidently a rough fellow, but
he had a heart, and the way in which he pressed the
hand of the young scout-master, after the whole
story had been told, indicated very plainly that he
sympathized greatly with him in his mission, and
would do everything in his power to bring about a
meeting with the strange man who had entered the
swamp ten days before, with that pretty child.</p>
<p>And Thad looked fully a hundred per cent
brighter, now that the chances for accomplishing
the end he had in view when he came South, seemed
to have gained a new impetus. With such a man
as Alligator Smith to lead them, knowing every
part of the mysterious depths of the swamp as he
did, from long years of hunting in its depths, it
really looked as though they were now on the road
to success; and that before long the truth would
be made known. So that everybody, even Bumpus,
seemed to be in a more jolly mood than had
happened in some time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII.
<br /><span class="small">WHAT A SCOUT STANDS FOR.</span></h2>
<p>Things were certainly looking much more rosy
now. With an experienced swamp man to guide
them, there would no longer be that danger of getting
lost that had kept hovering over their heads.</p>
<p>Then there was the white winged dove of peace
in the camp in connection with the solving of the
dreadful mystery that had been bothering Giraffe
and some of the others, all in fact but Bumpus and
Step Hen, for so long.</p>
<p>They sat around the fire, which did not feel at
all uncomfortable, enjoying the communion with
this &ldquo;unique character,&rdquo; as Smithy privately termed
the alligator skin collector.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I been hearin&rsquo; a heap &rsquo;bout this Boy Scout bizness,&rdquo;
the man finally remarked, after he had been
observing many of the ways of the boys, that had
more or less connection with their patrol teaching;
&ldquo;an&rsquo; I jest don&rsquo;t git on tuh the objeck o&rsquo; theh same.
Be yuh agwine tuh grow up tuh be sogers, an&rsquo; is
them uniforms a sign o&rsquo; the same?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! no, like a good many other people you&rsquo;ve
got the wrong idea of this Boy Scout business, Mr.
Smith,&rdquo; Thad told him. &ldquo;In America, the movement
hasn&rsquo;t anything whatever to do with the military
spirit, except that it tries to make a boy follow
out some of the rules that soldiers are bound by.
He must try and be brave, obey when ordered by
one in authority; be respectful to his superiors, and
keep himself clean, both in mind and body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though they don&rsquo;t always do that last,&rdquo; interjected
Davy Jones, as he cast a black look toward
the lolling Bumpus; who only answered him by a
derisive smile, and a good-natured nod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me some more, son,&rdquo; said the guide, showing
great interest. &ldquo;If them ijees kin be kerried
out, I sure reckons I knows sum boys what had orter
jine the scout movement in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I couldn&rsquo;t begin to tell you a tenth of
what scouts are supposed to do and know,&rdquo; Thad
went on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s done the greatest lot of good for
most of us right here. Where a boy was weak and
timid it makes him healthy and self-reliant. Where
he may have been silly he becomes thoughtful, learning
to <i>do</i> things instead of having others do them
for him. No boy can subscribe to the twelve rules
that he does, without it making him better in every
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;pose yuh tell me what them same rules be,
son, &rsquo;case I&rsquo;m thet int&rsquo;rested I&rsquo;d like tuh know,&rdquo;
the guide went on to say.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>It was a subject which Thad never wearied of
talking about, because his whole heart was wrapped
up in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, here they are then,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;When a boy joins a patrol he has to promise to
observe what is called scout law. That is, he will
do his level best to be trustworthy, loyal, helpful,
friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty,
brave, clean and reverent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, thet same sounds good tuh me, son,&rdquo;
the guide went on to declare. &ldquo;I jest don&rsquo;t know
plumb all yuh mean by sum o&rsquo; them words, but I
git the ijee all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; continued Thad, &ldquo;you can see that even
in trying to do what he promises, a boy is bound
to stop telling lies, taking things that belong to
others, talking meanly about his companions and
all such things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Especially that last!&rdquo; broke in Bumpus, giving
Davy and Giraffe an eloquent glance as he
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, seems tuh me as how they might be a
heap o&rsquo; good in this heah scout bizness,&rdquo; Tom Smith
remarked. &ldquo;But how about fightin&rsquo;, son; yuh
didn&rsquo;t say anything on thet line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing said about it, except that a
scout must keep the peace under all circumstances,
unless as a last resort,&rdquo; Thad told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on an&rsquo; explain her some more, please; I
don&rsquo;t jest ketch on tuh thet,&rdquo; the guide admitted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Thad, &ldquo;there may be occasions
when a scout could hardly be expected to keep the
peace, because he&rsquo;s a real flesh and blood boy, you
know, and not a saint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; Alligator Smith remarked, with a
grin, as he swept his eyes around at the circle of
eager boyish faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he should be set on by a superior force he
would not be expected to stand and turn the other
cheek, and be mauled,&rdquo; Giraffe broke in with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thet is, he kin defend hisself, yuh mean?&rdquo;
Tom Smith asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, in an emergency,&rdquo; Thad told him. &ldquo;Then
again, if he happened to see a big bully picking on
a poor little chap, or a girl it might be, why, he&rsquo;d
be doing the right thing if he interfered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if he had to fight to get peace,&rdquo; chuckled
Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But seems tuh me if this heah thing goes on
it mout make the boys kinder timid. We needs
brave men, such as kin go tuh war if need be. I
jest don&rsquo;t know how thet&rsquo;ll turn out, son.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I do,&rdquo; said the young scout-master,
firmly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had considerable experience with
boys who became scouts. I&rsquo;ve known lots of them
who waked up and became just the opposite to what
they used to be. I&rsquo;ve seen them stop going through
the world as though they were wearing horse&rsquo;s
blinders, and then they found a thousand things
that had been around them all the while, but they
hadn&rsquo;t known it before. I&rsquo;ve started them on the
way to studying the habits of the birds, fishes, animals
and insects to be met with in the woods and
waters until they seemed to live in a different world.
I&rsquo;ve watched sleepy, dull boys change into wide-awake,
alert scouts, surprising their parents and
teachers in school by the new interest they took in
life. But Mr. Smith, I give you my word that I
never yet knew of a true blue scout who was a
coward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear! hear!&rdquo; cried Bob White, clapping his
hands with delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; continued Thad, enthusiastically,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve watched more than a few boys who were
known to be next door to cowards, change into resolute
fellows, brave and self-reliant. One went into
a burning house and saved an old man at the risk
of his own life. Another stopped a runaway horse
with as much skill as a policeman educated for the
business might have shown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew of another who saved a drowning chum,
and I could tell you about a boy who hung on to a
thief who was robbing a woman on the street, taking
a fearful pounding, yet keeping him from running
away until help came, and then fainting. Yet
that same boy was afraid of his own shadow up to
the time he became a scout.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard theh like o&rsquo; thet, son,&rdquo; declared
the deeply interested guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Pears like they hain&rsquo;t nawthin&rsquo; a scout ain&rsquo;t
ekal tuh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing that&rsquo;s worth while, and that&rsquo;s the
truth,&rdquo; Thad told him. &ldquo;They can win merit
badges by excelling in certain lines. If you look
around right now, you&rsquo;ll perceive that every boy in
this Silver Fox Patrol of Cranford Troop wears
at least one medal or badge. And let me tell you,
sir, a scout is as proud of his badge as anybody
could be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, wall, but sure this heah is int&rsquo;restin&rsquo; tuh
me,&rdquo; the hunter assured his new friends. &ldquo;And
I&rsquo;m right glad I run across you-all like I done.
Never wud a believed they was so much as was
good in this heah Boy Scout movement. Allers
reckoned as how it mout be summat o&rsquo; a lark, er
else jest agittin&rsquo; recruits fo&rsquo; the sojer job. Tell me
a heap mo&rsquo;, son. I kin listen tuh yuh talk fo&rsquo;
hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so Thad, assisted from time to time by
his chums, managed to explain many interesting
details connected with Boy Scout lore.</p>
<p>It was a subject of which he never tired, and in
which he believed, heart and soul.</p>
<p>Then in turn Thad asked questions, for he knew
this man would be able to tell them many interesting
facts connected with swamp life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>In turn they heard just how alligators were
hunted, usually at night time, with a blazing pine
knot in the bow of the dugout, by means of which
&ldquo;flare&rdquo; their eyes could be &ldquo;shined,&rdquo; so that a
single shot would place a victim to the credit of
the hide hunter; also how the skins were taken off,
roughly cured, and what price they brought in the
market.</p>
<p>Then the willing guide told how he trapped all
such animals as muskrats, raccoons, otter, foxes
and others that possessed fur worth securing.
Thad knew something about Northern methods
along these lines, but he found quite a difference
in the way things were done down in Dixie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; the scout-master went on to say,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve told us all about the fur, fin and feather
of this big swamp, how about the human beings who
live in it? We&rsquo;ve been told they&rsquo;re a queer lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon yuh heared &rsquo;bout right, son,&rdquo; admitted
the guide, with a smile, &ldquo;fust thar be quite a few
runaway convicts, coons that dassent show themselves
back whar they kim from. How they lives
I jest don&rsquo;t know, but my traps is empty more&rsquo;n a
few times, an&rsquo; when I sees tracks o&rsquo; bare feet alongside
I changes the location o&rsquo; thet Victor in a hurry.
I meet up with a black now an&rsquo; then, but they knows
old Alligator Smith ain&rsquo;t agwine tuh do &rsquo;em any
hurt so they don&rsquo;t molest me none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there others besides?&rdquo; asked Allan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, thar&rsquo;s a feller as I&rsquo;ve seen right smart, an
folks done say as he&rsquo;s a bad money maker, what
they calls a counterfeiter, though I jest don&rsquo;t know
how true that mout be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; broke in Step Hen, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d think a
location in the heart of Alligator Swamp would be
a pretty safe place for such a mint to hold out.
Not much danger of the detectives and revenue men
dropping in on him unexpected like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any more?&rdquo; asked Bumpus, so deeply interested
by all this narrative that he had been sitting
there without moving for half an hour, his big
head supported by his cupped hands, and his round
eyes glued on Alligator Smith&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s another feller as I knows on wot makes
moonshine whisky, but only in small lots, &rsquo;case he
can&rsquo;t git the cawn he wants fo&rsquo; his mash. Nobody
ever bothers ole Pap Dody, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s done made his
stuff yeahs and yeahs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems like this old swamp might hold a lot
of queer people and their secrets?&rdquo; remarked Giraffe,
yawning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certain do, son,&rdquo; replied the other, as he
helped himself for the third time to the strong
coffee the boys had made for him. &ldquo;But then yuh
must &rsquo;member as how she kivers a heap o&rsquo; territory.
I never did know jest how many miles acrost from
east to west this swamp is&mdash;anyway from ten to
twenty, and nigh as far from no&rsquo;th to south. But
I forgot tuh tell yuh &rsquo;bout the voodoo doctor or
medicine man.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! is there one of those horrible negro wizards
around here?&rdquo; and Smithy shuddered as he
put the question, showing that he must have read
more or less on the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He holds out on the other side, so we ain&rsquo;t
likely tuh run acrost him,&rdquo; Tom Smith went on.
&ldquo;They be heaps o&rsquo; the blacks as goes regular tuh
see him, an&rsquo; I been told as how they hev a regular
heathen fetish worship and dance like over in
Afric. But they ain&rsquo;t never offered up any human
sacrifice, as I heard tell on. If they knows what&rsquo;s
good fo &rsquo;em they&rsquo;ll fight shy o&rsquo; thet. The planters
&rsquo;round hyah wouldn&rsquo;t stand fo&rsquo; no sech goings on
as thet, nohow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the boys were showing signs of weariness,
and the hour had grown late, the scout-master decided
they had talked themselves out for one evening.</p>
<p>And so he went around to make sure that everything
was secure, the boats protected as on the preceding
night, the paddles, as well as all else of value
taken into the tents, and every object calculated to
tempt a prowling negro looked after.</p>
<p>The guide declared that he had no need of shelter,
but would lie on the ground. And woe to the
thief, either on two legs or four, who attempted
to invade the camp while he was around.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>His presence gave the boys much comfort.</p>
<p>They could lie down now and go to sleep without
worrying about the possibility of unwelcome
visitors. And as for Thad he shook hands with
himself in imagination every time he stopped to
think what a great thing the coming of Alligator
Smith meant, connected with the carrying out of
his plans.</p>
<p>All doubt could now be set aside. They were not
going to be lost, as had on several occasions threatened
to be the case. And when the mysterious
man and girl were finally found, perhaps Thad&rsquo;s
fondest hopes would be realized.</p>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><span class="small">MORE TROUBLE ALL AROUND.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, Thad, it was all a mistake; we went
and buried the wrong thing after all, and I don&rsquo;t
care who knows it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davy looked fixedly at the back of Bumpus&rsquo; head
while he was saying this, for they were once more
in the boats, moving along, and Bumpus had the
bow, then Step Hen, Davy and Thad the steersman,
in the stern.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now what&rsquo;s ailing you, Davy?&rdquo; demanded
Step Hen; &ldquo;seems like you&rsquo;re never happy any
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;d only shake off that cold Bumpus
gave you, so you could get that onion scent, like
I do this minute, chances are you wouldn&rsquo;t be feelin&rsquo;
any too happy either,&rdquo; lamented Davy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I declare I thought that was all buried
with the onions,&rdquo; said Bumpus, trying to twist his
fat neck so he could look around, but failing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, but it wasn&rsquo;t, all the same,&rdquo; avowed
the complaining one, &ldquo;&rsquo;cause it&rsquo;s just as rank as
ever. Wait till I tell Giraffe when we go ashore
at noon, and say, you&rsquo;ll see a mad fellow then, with
all them onions sacrificed for nothing, and him that
fond of them, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have got the greatest imagination of anybody
I ever saw,&rdquo; declared Bumpus, indignantly.
&ldquo;To me the air is as sweet as anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you ain&rsquo;t got a big chump wearing
a greasy old suit asitting right to windward of
you,&rdquo; burst out Davy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Step Hen, ain&rsquo;t the air all right?&rdquo; demanded
the accused one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to pass me, boys; I&rsquo;m out of the
smelling class right now. I don&rsquo;t believe I could
even smell a rat, as they say. Fight it out between
you, but don&rsquo;t drag me in. Some other time I&rsquo;ll
act as judge and jury, but not to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I know what I know,&rdquo; Davy went on to
say stubbornly, &ldquo;and if me&rsquo;n Giraffe can manage
it there&rsquo;ll be a scout alookin&rsquo; a hundred per cent
cleaner than he is now, by to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better look out,&rdquo; warned Bumpus, belligerently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lookout yourself, where you&rsquo;re running us,&rdquo;
cried Davy.</p>
<p>Somehow or other the boat left its course and
scraped into the overhanging branches. Perhaps
this was only a clever little trick on the part of
Thad, calculated to break up the dispute between
the two scouts, which was rapidly becoming rather
acrimonious.</p>
<p>It had the expected result, if this was Thad&rsquo;s
design, for all of them found it necessary to scramble
around, using both hands to protect their eyes
from the intruding branches, so that when the boat
finally came out into the open again, Davy forgot
to resume his discussion, and just suffered in silence.</p>
<p>The alligator hunter, in his own boat, led the
van of the procession. With so clever and reliable a
guide to depend on Thad wasted no time in marking
the way, for so long as Tom Smith stayed by
them they did not anticipate having any further
trouble in getting out of the swamp.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it had become second nature for
Thad and Allan to take mental notes of all things
as they went along, a good habit that may often
prove valuable in the extreme.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>No scout can afford to fail to keep all his senses
on the alert when in the woods or on the waters.
Besides seeing many interesting things that less observant
lads would pass blindly by, he notices the
lay of the land, the direction of his course, and a
multitude of queer formations that may easily be
recognized again in case of necessity.</p>
<p>Thad knew that they were going in a new direction,
and had been ever since starting out immediately
after breakfast.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly Tom Smith had been considering
the whole matter, after learning all those important
points connected with the case. He had settled
upon the region where they would be most apt to
come upon the man and girl whom Thad yearned
to meet.</p>
<p>First of all the swamp hunter felt positive that
those they sought could not be anywhere along his
haunts, because he must have come upon traces of
them while running his lines of traps.</p>
<p>In like manner he judged that they were not over
at the other side of the swamp, where the voodoo
doctor had his cabin, and the strange shed where
the ignorant blacks gathered in the dark of the
moon to carry on their strange and uncouth religious
ceremonies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>Having eliminated at least half of the flooded
tract in this way Alligator Smith knew just what
territory he had to cover. And as Thad more than
suspected, he had undoubtedly laid a plan of campaign
in his mind, the first move in which he was
even now carrying out.</p>
<p>Not knowing how soon they might find themselves
in the neighborhood of the parties they hoped
to meet, the scout-master had given strict orders
that for the time being all manner of levity must
be laid aside.</p>
<p>That meant Davy must not attempt to climb,
monkey fashion, any trees when they came to land;
that Giraffe must tone down his loud voice; Bumpus
give up all thought of using his bugle, or even
warbling a strain of some favorite song&mdash;in fact
a subdued air must take the place of the boyish
hilarity that as a rule reigned in their midst.</p>
<p>And had not his other little plan held good, no
doubt Thad would have speedily given Davy to
know that he was making entirely too much noise.</p>
<p>After the little episode of the encounter with the
branches, the forward movement was continued for
a while in almost absolute silence.</p>
<p>The dip of paddles, the drip of water as they
were raised monotonously, the gurgle of the boats&rsquo;
passage&mdash;these were nearly the only faint sounds
heard in the swamp, which in places seems almost
devoid of life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>Some noisy fish crows cawed at them while flying
over, their sharp eyes discovering the creeping
canoes. A couple of buzzards sitting on a
branch of a dead tree, jumped into the air and
went flapping away at their near approach. There
were always water moccasins, either gliding down
from the exposed roots of trees where they had
been sunning themselves, or coiling up in the water
aggressively, until struck by the sharp edge of a
paddle blade, when they would writhe in agony,
and sink.</p>
<p>It was getting more and more gruesome all the
time, and Thad took notice of numerous things
that he had not seen before, in the other section
of the swamp.</p>
<p>Evidently the alligator hunter believed Thad was
following the wrong track for he had turned in
another direction entirely. Perhaps the boat that
had made the numerous signs Thad was searching
for and using as a trail, had been that of Alligator
Smith himself on his way in and out, and not the
one containing the mysterious man and girl.</p>
<p>But Thad was quite satisfied with what they had
done. He believed that in the end the hide hunter
would take them where they wanted to go; and
more than that they could hardly ask.</p>
<p>The three boats were very close together as the
midday hour drew near when, without the least
warning there sounded the report of a rifle from
some point not far away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>And the scouts not accustomed to being under
fire, experienced a thrill in the region of their hearts
when every one heard the strange zip-zip of a bullet
cutting through the air just above their heads.</p>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><span class="small">SWAMP TACTICS.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Back water, fellows!&rdquo; called out Step Hen,
who could be cautious at times, as well as bold.</p>
<p>It was ludicrous to see how quickly the scouts
did dip their paddles in again, and not only stay the
forward progress of the two canoes, but cause
them to retrograde so that almost like magic they
had succeeded in putting a tongue of land, on which
trees grew densely, between themselves and the
danger zone.</p>
<p>This did not apply so much to the alligator hunter,
who still sat there in his boat, fingering his
heavy rifle, and with bent head eying the distance,
as though it would please him exceedingly to just
catch a single glimpse of something moving, at
which he might discharge his weapon.</p>
<p>If Tom Smith were anything like the sharpshooter
he made out to be, the result must certainly
have proved disastrous to that unknown party who
had just given the little expedition such a start.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see the coward, Mr. Smith?&rdquo; called
out Bumpus, who was highly indignant at their receiving
such a warm reception; just as though this
unknown person meant to claim the whole swamp
as his preserves, and intended to serve warning on
the scouts that they had better clear out, if they
knew what was good for their health.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry tuh say I don&rsquo;t seem tuh git the least
sign o&rsquo; the measly critter!&rdquo; came the reply, in a
tone that told of mingled disgust and disappointment.</p>
<p>Saying which the alligator hunter picked up his
paddle in one hand, and still holding on to his gun,
as if hope were not quite extinct, he urged his canoe
backward, as though meaning to join the boys.</p>
<p>Thad understood that this was not done from
the same motives of caution that had caused them to
retreat under fire. Tom Smith must have some
other object in view, which would presently be
made apparent.</p>
<p>And as it turned out Thad&rsquo;s guess was pretty
close to the bull&rsquo;s-eye; for hardly had the guide
joined them than he was saying hurriedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gwine tuh leave you fo&rsquo; a leetle time, boys;
but make shuah tuh stay right hyah till I comes
back agin, which I calc&rsquo;late ain&rsquo;t meanin&rsquo; mo&rsquo;n harf
an hour at theh most.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Tom?&rdquo; asked Giraffe, who had
easily become familiar with the lanky hide hunter;
just as though the fact that both were tall and thin
had served to draw them closer together than was
the case with Bumpus, who, being built on an altogether
different plan, could not be expected to
sympathize with one who was all bone and muscle.</p>
<p>And as like draws like, Tom had even come to
calling Giraffe by his nick-name, because he heard
the others doing so; though possibly the man did
not know what such an animal looked like, as most
of his life had been spent in the swamps; and while
Louisiana boasts many queer animals and birds
within her borders, no one ever yet ran across a
giraffe running wild there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yuh see, Giraffe, I&rsquo;m ameanin&rsquo; tuh slip
&rsquo;round back thar, an&rsquo; see now if I couldn&rsquo;t git a
squint at thet sneak. So-long, boys, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t take
snap judgment on me, if yuh sees the bushes
amovin&rsquo; when I kim back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He immediately bent to his paddle, and the
rough boat started away at a furious pace, showing
that Tom Smith was deeply in earnest in his
desire to pay back the unseen marksman who had
given warning of his hostile intentions by that shot
over their heads.</p>
<p>They watched him for the space of about a
minute, and then boat and paddler had vanished
amidst the thick green screen of bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! but didn&rsquo;t he send her along like fun,
though?&rdquo; Bumpus wanted to know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s been using the paddle for a good
many years, and knows every little wrinkle of the
business,&rdquo; returned Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Allan, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m never through watching
the way he manages that clumsy canoe of his.
I&rsquo;ve seen Penobscot Indians up in Maine who
could do wonders with their boats, but they weren&rsquo;t
in the same class with him; because in the first
place their canoes were either made of light birch-bark,
or else canvas, painted and varnished until
the sides were as smooth as glass; whereas, look
at the tub he handles like a flash. He&rsquo;s sure a wonder;
and while I thought I could do a few stunts
along the line of canoe work, I take off my hat to
Tom Smith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what did he mean by saying like he did,
that he hoped we wouldn&rsquo;t take snap judgment
on him?&rdquo; Bumpus asked. &ldquo;That sounded mighty
funny to me, because of course we ain&rsquo;t thinking
of doing the least thing to annoy our own guide.
Why, whatever could we do without him now, I
wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>Giraffe chuckled, as he often did in his aggravating
way whenever Bumpus exposed his ignorance;
but all the same, in spite of his affected
superiority, the lanky scout was seen to pay particular
attention when Thad started in to explain;
just as though he might after all not be quite so
sure himself what Tom Smith did mean by that
expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s this way, Bumpus,&rdquo; said the scoutmaster,
always willing to enlighten the other, &ldquo;he
knows that we are more or less excited over this
unexpected happening; and as boys are apt to act
first, and think afterwards, Tom Smith wanted to
kindly request us not to shoot at the moving of a
branch, and look up the cause later on. The chances
are that it would be him coming back, and he didn&rsquo;t
feel like being peppered by our fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! he ought to have known that all scouts
learn never to shoot until they&rsquo;re good and sure of
what they&rsquo;re firing at,&rdquo; grunted Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, lots of people you&rsquo;d think ought to know
better, allow themselves to get so flustered when
deer hunting, that they&rsquo;re ready to bang away if
they see anything brown moving among the bushes.
And every year dozens of hunters are killed up in
the Adirondacks, in Maine, and Wisconsin, by just
such fool actions; so that they&rsquo;re even talking of
making every hunter wear either a white or a red
suit, so he can&rsquo;t be mistaken for a deer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fact, this dun-colored khaki cloth is
mighty near like a deer, and the dead leaves too!&rdquo;
declared Bumpus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;It may have been when it was new and <i>clean</i>,&rdquo;
interjected Davy, bitterly; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s anything but
brown now. I&rsquo;d call it a pretty fair shade of dirt
color approaching black.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;raps, now, that&rsquo;s why the sportsmen in Old
England wear red coats when they go into the
brush?&rdquo; suggested Smithy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s only the fox hunters, and they carry
no firearms, so they&rsquo;re in no danger,&rdquo; Thad informed
him; &ldquo;their grouse shooters wear just the
same kind of togs our hunters do over here; but
they shoot in the open, and so you seldom hear of
an accident over across the ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this conversation was carried on in low tones,
and while the boys were constantly peeping out
from their leafy covert, as though expecting to
catch a glimpse of either the mysterious marksman,
or else Tom Smith searching for him beyond.</p>
<p>But there was not a single sign of either. The
trailing Spanish moss continued to wave majestically
to and fro in the light air; a gray squirrel ran down
the trunk of an oak tree close by, to bark saucily,
as though questioning their right in his quiet domain;
a bittern flew past with winnowing wing, and
quickened its flight when discovering the presence
of human beings in that retreat; but there did not
seem to be the first indication that either enemy or
friend could be hidden beyond that other tongue of
land.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Thad had figured it all out in his mind, and fancied
that he knew about what the quickly-formed
plan of the alligator hunter might be.</p>
<p>Of course Tom Smith knew every rod of this
place, and he realized that by taking a certain channel
leading back of the point that now screened
the boys, he could manage to come up behind the
place where that rifle had sounded.</p>
<p>If the marksman had remained in his bushy retreat
there was a chance of his being surprised;
but Thad hardly hoped for any such result; because
it stood to reason that the hidden man must
be keen-witted, and he would naturally suspect some
such move on the part of the swamp hunter, whom
he undoubtedly knew.</p>
<p>The minutes dragged along, with the boys exchanging
opinions every little while, and then looking
around again. They felt under something of a
strain, because of this singular happening; and
many were the conjectures as to who the party could
be back of that gun.</p>
<p>Some were inclined to believe that he might
turn out to be a desperate escaped convict who had
managed in some fashion to get possession of firearms;
and seeing those deceptive khaki suits of the
scouts, at once jumped to the conclusion that they
must belong to the State militia, and were even then
looking for a fellow answering his description.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Others declared that if this had been the case
he would surely have sent his whistling lead lower,
and not stopped at simply warning them to clear
out. And it was even hinted by Giraffe that the
unseen party might be the counterfeiter of whom
they had heard Tom Smith speak, and who would
naturally believe the Government had sent an expedition
after him at last, tired of his persistent efforts
to inflate the currency of the country at the
expense of his fellows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Thad, don&rsquo;t you know, over half an
hour&rsquo;s gone already, and not a sign of our guide
coming back?&rdquo; observed Bumpus, who had remained
quiet for a long stretch of time, for him,
because the fat scout dearly loved to express his
opinions on every subject. &ldquo;I only hope nothing
can have happened to Mr. Smith, because we would
be up a tree then. I just know even you haven&rsquo;t
kept track of how we got here; and if there ain&rsquo;t
no trail, however would we get out again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you go again, Bumpus,&rdquo; asserted Step
Hen, &ldquo;borrowing trouble. Why don&rsquo;t you wait
till you get to a bridge before you start crossing
over? Now, as for me, I&rsquo;m ready to just take
things easy-like, till Tom shows up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is now, and beckoning to us to come
along!&rdquo; asserted Old Eagle Eye, who had kept on
the alert all the while, so that he might be the first
to announce a pleasing discovery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>When Giraffe had thus announced his discovery,
the two canoes were immediately put in motion,
and the boys hastened to paddle along until they arrived
alongside the boat of the guide, which was
close to the spot where that mysterious shot had
sprung from.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon you didn&rsquo;t find our friend, Tom?&rdquo; remarked
Giraffe, familiarly.</p>
<p>The old alligator-skin collector shook his head
grimly in the negative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He slipped out all right,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;an&rsquo;
so slick thet I never did git even a look-in at him.
But I found his blank brass shell on the ground,
whar he tossed the same outen his gun, which I
knows real well. It war Ricky, the moonshiner, as
guv yuh thet warnin&rsquo; not tuh bother with him; an&rsquo;
I reckons as how he means hit, too.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV.
<br /><span class="small">STILL BUMPING BUMPUS.</span></h2>
<p>Various were the expressions of disgust when
the scouts heard this piece of intelligence from
the guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what d&rsquo;ye think of that now, for a piece
of nerve?&rdquo; exclaimed Step Hen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;Seems just like this here Ricky, whose first
name must be Gin, I reckon, thinks he owns pretty
much all Alligator Swamp, because he&rsquo;s held out
here so long, and nobody ever bothered him before!&rdquo;
Bumpus lamented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the use talking that way, fellows?&rdquo;
said Giraffe, almost fiercely; &ldquo;none of us expect to
clear out just because Mr. Ricky says we&rsquo;ve got to
go. If he expects that he&rsquo;s given us the worst
scare of our lives, he&rsquo;s got another think acoming
to him, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Giraffe, you never spoke truer words than
that,&rdquo; cried Davy Jones, suddenly firing up, and
showing unexpected zeal in the matter; he had a
way of stretching his eyes when under any sort of
excitement, and in this way made the other boys
laugh at his looks; but just then, somehow, no one
even smiled, for they were too much taken up with
the seriousness of the conditions confronting them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it strikes me about the same way,&rdquo; spoke
up Bob White, with his customary Southern eagerness,
&ldquo;the Silver Fox Patrol has gone through with
too many adventures in its time to get scared off,
just because one old moonshiner chances to feel
ugly that we&rsquo;ve had to come into this swamp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d better take care,&rdquo; warned Smithy, who
seemed fully as much worked up as any of the rest
of them; &ldquo;or we might make up our minds to kill
two birds with one stone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what!&rdquo; echoed Bumpus, aggressively;
&ldquo;while we&rsquo;re alooking up this here Felix, why, if
we&rsquo;re forced to show our hand without a glove,
p&rsquo;raps we&rsquo;ll take a notion to pull old Ricky in, and
hand him over to the revenue officers. Maybe
there might be some sort of reward out for him;
and we&rsquo;ve made our expenses before now in helping
the hands of justice. Remember what we did up
in Maine, boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and please move our boat a little to the
right, will you, Allan, because somehow I think
the air comes a mite finer from that quarter,&rdquo; and
Giraffe as he said this almost glared at Bumpus;
who returned his look with one of pretended indifference,
as he fondly stroked his dingy old khaki
jacket that was so discolored from long and hard
use that one could hardly tell what the original
color may have been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope now we ain&rsquo;t going back, anyhow?&rdquo;
the fat scout remarked, calmly.</p>
<p>All eyes were turned upon the scout-master, as
though the decision must rest entirely with him;
but then they knew Thad well enough to feel sure
he never backed down in anything he attempted
until the very last word had been said.</p>
<p>And then again they must have found more or
less consolation in the fact that it was his particular
business that had brought them all the way into
Dixieland; the possibility of finding his long lost
little sister would spur Thad on to reaching his
goal, if there were a dozen Ricky moonshiners in
the way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>Just as they hoped and expected, he lost no time
in settling the matter, at least as far as he was concerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here to find that man with the little girl,
boys, and we&rsquo;re bound to do it, by hook or by
crook,&rdquo; he said, quietly, but in that firm tone they
knew so well. &ldquo;If this man who makes the moonshine
stuff chooses to get in our way and show himself
disagreeable, why, we may have to turn aside
for a little while, and teach him that it isn&rsquo;t always
safe to interfere with other people&rsquo;s business, even if
they do happen to be Boy Scouts. And I&rsquo;m sure
our guide here, Tom Smith, will stand by us
through it all, won&rsquo;t you, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, the swamp hunter was having his eyes
opened right along to the possibilities of boys under
the new way of making them think for themselves,
and the more he saw of Thad and his seven
chums, the higher his admiration arose. So when
the young scout-master thus appealed to him, he
was quick to assure them of his constancy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lived around hyah fo&rsquo; a good many yeahs,
an&rsquo; minded my own bizness right along so &rsquo;at Ricky
an&rsquo; me we-all never hed any fallin&rsquo; out; but I sez
right now, thet if he thinks he kin chase you boys
outen Alligator Swamp, jest &rsquo;cause yuh happens tuh
be wearin&rsquo; them uniforms as makes him &rsquo;spicious
like, he&rsquo;s beatin&rsquo; up the wrong tree, thet&rsquo;s all.
I&rsquo;ll stick tuh yuh through thick an&rsquo; thin; and Ricky,
he bettah go slow, thet&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; put in Thad, hastily, as with a
movement of the hand he checked the cheer that
arose to the lips of several of the more enthusiastic
scouts; &ldquo;we&rsquo;d rather not have the least trouble with
the man, because, you understand, we never even
knew of his being here until we started in to try
and find the others; but if he&rsquo;s as obstinate as a
mule&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or Bumpus here,&rdquo; interjected Davy, as quick as
a flash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; Thad went on to say, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have to
pay attention to him first of all, because it&rsquo;s unpleasant
to think that at any minute you&rsquo;re apt to be
shot at from ambush, by some one who is hidden behind
a tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never did sot any store by this hyah bushwhackin&rsquo;
bizness,&rdquo; declared their guide, frowning.
&ldquo;And Ricky, he&rsquo;s bound tuh git hisself intuh a
heap o&rsquo; trouble if so be he tries thet same on, many
more times.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking,&rdquo; resumed Thad, &ldquo;that perhaps,
now, there might be some way for you to get in
touch with Ricky, or leave a communication for
him somewhere. In that way you could tell him
who we were, and that we haven&rsquo;t any notion of doing
him any harm. In fact, so far as we&rsquo;re concerned,
it doesn&rsquo;t matter if he keeps on with his little
still in the swamp till doomsday, does it, boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, if only he keeps his hands off, and don&rsquo;t
bother the Silver Fox Patrol in the line of their
duty,&rdquo; asserted Giraffe. &ldquo;Some other people, just
about like this same old Ricky, learned that it was
as safe to monkey with a buzz-saw as to fool with
scouts when they&rsquo;re bent on minding their own affairs.
I could mention more&rsquo;n a few who got
their fingers pinched, and pinched bad too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t bother going into details now,
Giraffe,&rdquo; remarked Allan; &ldquo;all that will keep for
some time when we&rsquo;re sitting around the fire, and
you happen to feel like telling our guide a few
things about what we&rsquo;ve done in the past. Just
now we&rsquo;ve got to settle on our plans for work.
How about what Thad asked you, Tom Smith;
can you manage to get word to this Ricky, do you
think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The swamp hunter had been thinking while the
boys exchanged these few remarks; and now he
nodded his head in the affirmative.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;I kinder reckons as how I mout do thet same,
son,&rdquo; he went on to say, as though his mind were
made up. &ldquo;In the fust place, I knows jest whar
Ricky he holds out, an&rsquo; hes his ole still; an&rsquo; I wants
tuh say thet I don&rsquo;t reckon tuh find them parties
yuh be alookin&rsquo; fo&rsquo; in thet ere quarter. So, yuh
see, we&rsquo;s soon gwine tuh head in a diff&rsquo;rent way,
so Ricky, if so be he&rsquo;s a watchin&rsquo; on us frum the
bushes&rsquo;ll make out thet we don&rsquo;t mean tuh disturb
him yet awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, he might think we were only going around
to come up on him from another quarter?&rdquo; ventured
Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added the scout-master, &ldquo;and if you can
let him know what I said about our being only
Boy Scouts; and that we&rsquo;ve hired you, not to find
him, but another party altogether, it might be best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;s a chanct tuh do thet same,&rdquo; returned
Tom Smith; &ldquo;an&rsquo; this is theh way o&rsquo; hit. Yuh see,
Ricky he don&rsquo;t never show hisself outen the swamp,
leastways not in daytime, &rsquo;cause he reckons as how
thar be a marshal behind every tree, jest awaitin&rsquo;
tuh nab him fo&rsquo; moonshinin&rsquo;. But he sells his
mountain dew, as they calls it up in Georgia an&rsquo;
Tennessee tuh sum o&rsquo; theh natives, an&rsquo; when they
wants a supply they leaves word at his post office
like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I see, Ricky isn&rsquo;t only trying to beat the
United States Government out of its revenue on
the stuff he distills, but he&rsquo;s set up a rival establishment
for sending letters through the mails without
paying a cent of postage?&rdquo; and Giraffe chuckled
at his own wit, which Bumpus thought very bad
taste; but then Bumpus was provoked at the lanky
scout just then, and could not see anything good in
whatever Giraffe said or did.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;And can you get a note into that private post
office without too much trouble?&rdquo; Thad asked,
quite interested, and ready to carry out the little
scheme with all the speed possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; resumed the swamp hunter, &ldquo;hit happens
thisaway, yuh see; we&rsquo;s bound tuh pass right
neah thet holler tree, whar Ricky allers looks fo&rsquo;
letters; an&rsquo; if so be yuh guv me a note tuh stick
in the hole, chances are he&rsquo;d see me do hit, an&rsquo; be
ahookin&rsquo; theh same out arter I quits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Ricky can read?&rdquo; queried Allan, as
though surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him?&rdquo; ejaculated Tom Smith, as though surprised
at the question; &ldquo;sure he kin, an&rsquo; write too.
Why, I &rsquo;members him atellin&rsquo; as how he went tuh
school an&rsquo; got book larnin&rsquo; a whole winter, long
time ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye think of that?&rdquo; ejaculated Step
Hen. &ldquo;Suppose, now, Ricky had had half the
chances of us fellows, wouldn&rsquo;t he set the world on
fire, though? Only went to school one winter
when he was a boy, and learned to read and write
at that. I&rsquo;m ashamed to say it, but there are some
chaps I know that have been agoing to school all
their lives, and don&rsquo;t know much more&rsquo;n how to
read and write.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;Speak for yourself, Step Hen,&rdquo; said Bumpus,
who seemed unusually touchy these days, and resented
the significant way in which the other looked
in his direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write a few lines then,&rdquo; said Thad, &ldquo;and
make it as plain as I can that we don&rsquo;t mean Ricky
any harm, and would rather than not he helped us
find that strange man with the little girl; for I
suppose he must have noticed him around in the
swamp, and has wondered what they were doing
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! as fo&rsquo; thet,&rdquo; chuckled the guide, &ldquo;nobody
ever questions what a feller is after when he hides
in ole Alligator Swamp; &rsquo;case, yuh see, it&rsquo;s allers
been a safe retreat fo&rsquo; every escaped convict, and
sech others as want tuh keep outen sight. I hev
heard as how in theh ole days o&rsquo; slavery many a
black took tuh this place arter runnin&rsquo; away from
the sugar plantations; and they used tuh hunt &rsquo;em
with bloodhounds. Fack is, right in these hyah
days I&rsquo;ve heard the bayin&rsquo; o&rsquo; hounds more&rsquo;n a few
times; and I done larn on&rsquo;y yesterday as how the
sheriff, he went an&rsquo; fotched a brace o&rsquo; dorgs down
from another parish, tuh use the same hyah&rsquo;bouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad was already busily engaged, having secured
a page from a pocket notebook, and with the
stub of a pencil he was writing a few lines as
plainly as he could accomplish it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>Giraffe and Davy were whispering together as
their boats happened to drift close together, and
from the fact that they allowed their eyes to turn
toward Bumpus from time to time, it seemed probable
that some new scheme was being hatched looking
to the further annoyance of the fat scout.</p>
<p>Bumpus saw what was going on, and moved
uneasily, as though he suspected that some species
of bomb were being prepared to explode under him;
but he did not say anything, however much he may
have thought.</p>
<p>Thad had just folded the note, and handed the
same to Tom Smith, so that he could place it in the
tree post office as they came to it; when Giraffe
caught the attention of the scout-master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me&rsquo;n Davy here been conferring on a certain
matter, you see, Thad,&rdquo; he went on to say, apparently
half in earnest, yet with his eyes twinkling as
though a wicked sense of humor bubbled up within;
&ldquo;an&rsquo; while we hope you won&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re atrying
to start a mutiny of any sort, we would like to get
your opinion to a certain scheme to keep peace in
the family, and let the rest of us get our share of
good sweet air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, hurry up and state your case, Giraffe,&rdquo;
remarked Thad, who possibly could more than half
guess what was coming; &ldquo;because we&rsquo;ve lost time
enough already, and should be on the move.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s just this way,&rdquo; continued Giraffe,
after exchanging winks with Davy, as though looking
for encouragement there; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve tried our level
best to coax a certain member of this expedition
to be faithful to his vows, and stow away the greasy
old fishy suit he keeps on awearing; and he&rsquo;s just
that like a mule he won&rsquo;t do the first thing to accommodate
us. Now, we all feel that we&rsquo;ve got
rights, and Davy here thought up a plan whereby
Bumpus can keep on wearing his cast-offs if he
wants to, and have all the fun to himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! is that so?&rdquo; sneered the object of all this
tender solicitude; &ldquo;how kind of Davy, and you too,
Giraffe. Maybe, now, you&rsquo;ll go right along, and
explain how this same miracle&rsquo;s agoing to be fixed?
This suit is an old friend of mine, and I just love
it. Course, if Thad lets you, and the whole bunch
pile on, I can&rsquo;t hold out against seven; but that
ain&rsquo;t the way to treat a fellow scout. Go right
along and explain what Davy&rsquo;s plan is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, here&rsquo;s the scheme, and I must say it&rsquo;s a
grand good one,&rdquo; Giraffe continued, bracing up to
make the explanation. &ldquo;Since Bumpus must save
his good suit, let him, if only he don&rsquo;t bother the
rest of us so furiously. Now, there&rsquo;s the boat of
our guide; let him change places with Tom Smith,
and follow away behind the balance of the expedition.
We could wave him back whenever we
thought he was getting too close, you know. And I
want to say the plan has my unqualified endorsement,
and does our chum Davy great credit. Now,
what&rsquo;s the verdict. Thad? Does Bumpus either
have to agree to throw away that old suit of his; or
get in the guide&rsquo;s canoe, and go away back and sit
down? We&rsquo;re content to abide by your decision in
the matter; and here&rsquo;s hoping you fix it to suit the
majority!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><span class="small">RICKY&rsquo;S POST OFFICE.</span></h2>
<p>Something like a snicker ran around the other
scouts when Giraffe proposed to punish the obstinate
Bumpus in this queer fashion. But there
was one among them who did not see anything so
comical in the idea, and this was the proposed victim
himself.</p>
<p>Bumpus looked daggers at Giraffe. Why, he
even picked up his gun, which chanced to be lying
near his position in the bow of the other canoe;
though of course he did not have the least idea of
resisting to that extent, should the decision be
averse to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I can see through a board that&rsquo;s got a
knot-hole in it, Giraffe Stedman!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
bitterly. &ldquo;Fact of the matter is, you&rsquo;re just jealous
of my figger, that&rsquo;s what, and all the while you
lie awake nights atrying to think up schemes that&rsquo;ll
make me have trouble, and in the end reduce my
flesh so fast that you won&rsquo;t be the only living skeleton
in the bunch. Right now you want to make
me paddle all by myself; and there ain&rsquo;t anything
calculated to thin a fellow more&rsquo;n that kind of business.
Thad, don&rsquo;t you see what he&rsquo;s after? And
I certainly do hope you won&rsquo;t let him crow over me.
I&rsquo;m losing enough weight as it is, aworrying over
that silly job of not remembering what I did with
my mother&rsquo;s medicine she sent me to fetch home;
let alone having to paddle ever and ever so many
weary miles. Tell him to get in Tom Smith&rsquo;s
canoe himself, and go on ahead, if so be he thinks
he&rsquo;s going to feel any better. You ain&rsquo;t once complained
about my dear old suit, Thad, neither has
Step Hen here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, go slow about me there, Bumpus,&rdquo; spoke
up the last mentioned party; &ldquo;for you see my
cold&rsquo;s agetting just a <i>little</i> bit better; and seems to
me at times I do notice something queer about the
air of this swamp. Tell you more later on, if I
keep improving like I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be enough for you, Giraffe,&rdquo; said Thad,
with an assumption of authority that announced his
belief that the time for levity was past; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll not
bother about such a little thing right now; but wait
until we get in camp after we&rsquo;ve settled the matter
of the man and the girl. Let&rsquo;s move along.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;Little thing&mdash;huh!&rdquo; grunted Davy, while Giraffe
and Bumpus exchanged grins, the one being
founded on triumph, in that Thad had decided in
his favor, while the elongated scout showed that
he had only been jesting after all, though pretending
to be so serious.</p>
<p>The guide had listened to all this side talk, and
seemed to be more or less amused, though like as
not he failed to catch the true essence of the joke.
But he had already grown to like these quick-witted
lads more than a little, and was trying hard to enter
into their way of looking at things.</p>
<p>He paddled on slowly, always keeping a bright
lookout ahead and around. Giraffe took occasion
to remark, after noticing how careful the swamp
hunter seemed to be, that according to his notion
Tom Smith was half expecting to hear that rifle of
the moonshiner bark again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whee!&rdquo; Bumpus was heard to say, half to himself;
and they noticed that after that the fat scout
managed to squat a little lower in his place, doubtless
thinking it the part of discretion to make himself
less of a shining mark, calculated to draw the
attention of any would-be marksman.</p>
<p>Not that Bumpus would have acknowledged feeling
<i>afraid</i>; but he might have declared that he did
not see why he should loom up there like a target,
while lucky fellows like Giraffe, who were as thin
as a knife blade, stood little chance of being hit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>All went smoothly for some little time, and as no
ugly sound like the report of a gun annoyed them,
the scouts began to get their full amount of courage
back again. But Bumpus apparently found his
new position of lolling in the bottom of the bow
of the canoe comfortable enough to please him, for
he made no attempt to sit up pompously again, as
had been his habit before.</p>
<p>The guide had kept just a little in the van, and
presently he turned to beckon, as though desirous
of having them join him; which those in the other
two boats immediately did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heah&rsquo;s theh post office, suh!&rdquo; remarked Tom
Smith, as he pointed toward a big half-rotten stump
of a tree that must have been broken off short in
some storm of years gone by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, that poor old thing?&rdquo; ejaculated Bumpus,
just as though visions of a post office conjured
up in his mind all sorts of elaborate buildings, with
crowds of country people gathering around as the
mail was being sorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thet heah is theh place, as sure as anything,&rdquo;
asserted the other; &ldquo;an&rsquo; jest hole on long enuff
tuh &rsquo;low me tuh slip yuh lettah in theh same, Thad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he said this Tom Smith paddled his canoe
alongside the bank, jumped out, and strode over to
the remnant of a once proud sentinel oak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>He seemed to know what he was about; perhaps
in times gone by he may himself have communicated
with old Ricky through means of this letter
box. At any rate the boys saw him reach up to a
break in the surface of the stump, and put his hand
inside. When he drew it out he no longer held the
little note that the scout-master had written, and
given into his charge.</p>
<p>Then Tom Smith once more embarked, and
joined them in his canoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I call a slick way to send letters,&rdquo;
Davy remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saves a heap of postage, for a fact,&rdquo; Bob White
chuckled; &ldquo;but then I&rsquo;ve seen the same done more
than a few times befo&rsquo;, suh, so it&rsquo;s nothing new to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, do you really and truly think old Ricky
might be awatching us right now, and see you put
something in his post office?&rdquo; Bumpus questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course I don&rsquo;t jest know fo&rsquo; sure,&rdquo; replied the
swamp hunter; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m summat &rsquo;quainted with his
ways, an&rsquo; I reckons as how it&rsquo;s likely he be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus looked all around, and then went on to
remark again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he wouldn&rsquo;t feel just like letting loose on
us because you went and stuffed his ballot-box,
would he? If he&rsquo;s as smart a man as you said,
after having been to school, he&rsquo;d guess that we had
some good reason for wanting to communicate with
him in this way; ain&rsquo;t that so, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you say, Bumpus; and make your mind
easy, we&rsquo;ll not be bothered again by Ricky,&rdquo; the
scout-master assured him. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get my letter,
and understand that we are not here to do him any
injury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Bumpus,&rdquo; remarked Smithy, &ldquo;I just want
to say that I couldn&rsquo;t have put that remark in better
English than you did, even if I tried my best. They
say that associations will tell in the long run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t plume yourself so much, Smithy,&rdquo; jeered
Davy; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t we also learn at school how &lsquo;evil
communications corrupt good manners?&rsquo; First
thing you know we&rsquo;ll be finding that you use slang;
and maybe won&rsquo;t change <i>your</i> old suit when it&rsquo;s
just so rank of onions and fishy odors from cooking,
that all your mates are groaning to beat the
band. Some things are as ketching as the measles,
they say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then when the fever strikes you, Giraffe,&rdquo; ventured
Bumpus quickly, seeing his chance, &ldquo;maybe
you&rsquo;ll give me a rest, and turn on Davy here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; was all Giraffe returned to this sly dig;
but he grinned as though satisfied to have made the
fat scout speak out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s on again now, I suppose, Tom Smith?&rdquo;
remarked Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, an&rsquo; right heah we makes summat o&rsquo; a turn,
so that from now on we don&rsquo;t reckon tuh keep
headin&rsquo; in ther direction o&rsquo; Ricky&rsquo;s still. He&rsquo;ll
foller us arter he gits yuh letter, suh; till he sees as
how we ain&rsquo;t calc&rsquo;latin&rsquo; tuh close in on his leetle
island still in the heart o&rsquo; theh swamp. Then like
as not he&rsquo;ll make up his mind they beant anythin&rsquo;
tuh skeer &rsquo;bout long o&rsquo; we-uns, an&rsquo; quit botherin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I say a good riddance of bad rubbish when
he takes that same notion,&rdquo; declared Bob White.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here!&rdquo; echoed Smithy; while the others
contented themselves with giving sundry nods, as
though their minds ran along the same channels.</p>
<p>So the swamp guide again started ahead, picking
his way through intricate channels that none of the
scouts believed they could ever recognize again;
though it was plain to be seen from the manner in
which Thad and Allan kept keenly observing all
their surroundings that they were trying to impress
the general run of things upon their minds, so that
in case it became necessary for them to take the
lead, through losing their guide in some fashion,
they might not be wholly unprepared.</p>
<p>And it was in this manner that the scout-master
constantly showed those who were under his charge
the necessity for constant watchfulness at all times,
when in the open. The boy who is &ldquo;prepared&rdquo;
has a great advantage over the one who never takes
note of what is transpiring around him. Not only
that, but he discovers a thousand splendid things in
the woods and waters about him that remain unknown
forever to the lad who will not arouse himself,
and do his own thinking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>They had been going for some little time in this
fashion, and already there were heard slight murmurs
from the place where Giraffe was seated concerning
what a light breakfast they had taken, and
that it must surely be getting on toward noon, when
Thad began to notice that the guide was acting
queerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch Tom Smith, Allan!&rdquo; he remarked to
the other, as the canoes were close together; and of
course every one of the other six scouts immediately
sat up and began to take notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Thad, there is something bothering
him,&rdquo; admitted Allan, after he had used his eyes
for a brief time to observe what the guide was
doing.</p>
<p>The alligator-hide hunter had stopped paddling,
although his canoe still continued to glide along
under the impetus it had received from his last few
vigorous strokes. He had raised his head, and
cocked it on side, as though listening to some sound
that caught his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe after all the old moonshiner didn&rsquo;t get
your message, Thad,&rdquo; suggested Step Hen; and
immediately Bumpus ceased trying to stretch his
thick neck in the endeavor to see over the heads of
those nearest him, and who were more or less interfering
with his view; &ldquo;p&rsquo;raps right now he&rsquo;s
atrailing after us, and meaning to give us heaps and
heaps of trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>Step Hen often made remarks like this that
proved how he failed to use a due regard for reason.
And the scout-master immediately showed him how
unlikely his suggestion was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place, Step Hen,&rdquo; Thad remarked,
&ldquo;if you look closer you&rsquo;ll see how he keeps looking
away ahead of us, and not behind. If old Ricky
had followed us, the chances are we&rsquo;d hear of him
back there somewhere, and not in advance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;re right, Thad,&rdquo; muttered Step Hen,
who at least was never so hard to convince as Bumpus;
and quick to see the point at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then again,&rdquo; resumed the other, pushing his
advantage vigorously, as every wide-awake scout
should always do; &ldquo;from the fact that none of us
seem to have sensed what Tom Smith has plainly
heard; it shows, not only that his hearing is better
than ours, but that the sounds, whatever they may
be, come from a distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardly had Thad said this than some of the
boys, upon straining their hearing to the utmost,
believed they caught certain sounds; or else the
wind happened to pick up a little just then, bringing
them closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Thad, was that a wolf; and do they have
such things down here in Louisiana?&rdquo; burst out
Bumpus, before any one else could speak.</p>
<p>Giraffe laughed harshly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the poor little innocent, Thad, the difference
between a baying hound and his first cousin
<i>lupus</i>, the wolf,&rdquo; he observed, with a lofty air that
was calculated to quite crush the fat scout, but did
nothing of the kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it is, boys, a baying hound!&rdquo; Thad
told them; &ldquo;and there, you can hear it louder than
before, which would seem to indicate either that
the breeze is getting stronger right along, or else
the dog is heading this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that the guide was saying a while
ago about the sheriff borrowing a couple of hounds
from some other parish to use down here?&rdquo; Davy
wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bloodhounds, more&rsquo;n likely,&rdquo; added Step Hen,
with his eyes widening, as though the possibilities
conjured up by this suggestion thrilled him to the
core.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s our good guide waiting for us to
join him,&rdquo; said Thad; &ldquo;and just as like as not he
may have something to tell us, for there seems to
be a puzzled look on his face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paddles were dipped in the water, and before
half a minute passed both canoe-loads of scouts
had come alongside the pilot boat in which Tom
Smith sat, rubbing his bearded chin thoughtfully
with one hand, while he continued to hold his head,
as though still listening to the rapidly growing baying
of that hound.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the answer, Tom?&rdquo; demanded Giraffe,
bluntly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been hearing that dog give
tongue, and wondered what there was about it to
make you look so sober. Is it a coon dog, and has
he got a bushy-tail up a tree? I&rsquo;ve heard &rsquo;em break
loose like that more&rsquo;n once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, younker,&rdquo; said the other, gravely, &ldquo;yuh
hain&rsquo;t never heard a coon dorg yap like that, let me
tell yuh. Ther dorg as gives them clar notes ain&rsquo;t
agwine tuh tuhn his head tuh look at a coon, &rsquo;cept
it be a two-legged un. I reckons I knows the
breed right well; an&rsquo; I wants tuh state thet yuh
listenin&rsquo; tuh a hound now as hes ben trained never to
run on any trail, deer, bar or coon, but a human un.
Thet&rsquo;s a bloodhound acomin&rsquo; thisaways; and like
as not thet sheriff hes picked out Alligator Swamp
tuh try out his new dorgs. An&rsquo; let me tell yuh,
thar must be sumthin&rsquo; in theh wind tuh make him
fotch his posse along whar no sheriff ever did cotch
his game up tuh this day. Times is achangin&rsquo;
down in old Louisiana, they be.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><span class="small">THE SHERIFF&rsquo;S ROUND-UP POSSE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;How will that affect your game, Thad, do you
think?&rdquo; asked Allan, anxiously, after the alligator
hunter had spoken so seriously about the possible
scouring of the big swamp by this energetic sheriff,
bound to clean it up at last, after it had borne such
a bad name for years and years as a harboring
place for desperate characters, voodoo worshippers
and all such.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied the scout-master, with
a line across his forehead, showing that the master
was already beginning to loom up in his mind as
something that must yet be experienced. &ldquo;Perhaps
we&rsquo;ll profit by his coming; and then again it
may be just the other way. But one thing sure,
no matter what we wish, it isn&rsquo;t going to change
things any. So we&rsquo;ll have to move along, and take
them as they come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;re heading this way, all right,&rdquo; said
Giraffe, &ldquo;because the yelps are getting louder all
the while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, please,&rdquo; broke in Bumpus at this interesting
juncture, &ldquo;however can a dog follow a
trail through the water? I don&rsquo;t know a great deal
of woodcraft, and tracking, and all that stuff, but
I reckon I&rsquo;ve read about fellows that were being
chased by dogs, throwing &rsquo;em off the scent by wading
down a stream half a mile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re right there, Bumpus,&rdquo; replied Allan,
immediately; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a trick as old as the hills,
and one that&rsquo;s been practiced from the days of the
Pilgrim Fathers. Nothing like water to upset the
keenest-nosed dog that ever lived.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Smithy, also anxious to air his
scanty knowledge along this line; &ldquo;and you can
read about just such a happening in one of Cooper&rsquo;s
old Leatherstocking tales. I remember distinctly
that such a thing occurred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But hold on, don&rsquo;t everybody butt in, and keep
me waiting so long,&rdquo; Bumpus interrupted again.
&ldquo;I asked Thad a question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll have to turn to Tom Smith here
for an answer,&rdquo; said the scout-master; &ldquo;though of
course it goes without saying that dogs would be
worth mighty little in case the fugitives were in
canoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dogs can swim, all right, but water leaves no
trail, they say,&rdquo; Step Hen ventured to remark,
wanting to be counted as having also placed his
opinion on record.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about this, Mr. Smith?&rdquo; asked Davy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, it mout be thisaway,&rdquo; the swamp hunter
told them; &ldquo;yuh kin see thet thar be a heap o&rsquo;
land in ridges &rsquo;round heah, an&rsquo; the dorgs is a runnin&rsquo;
o&rsquo; &rsquo;em out. Mebbe they be men in boats along
wid the rest; so day arter day they kin kiver a new
section, an&rsquo; jest clean up ther hull swamp in ther
end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why d&rsquo;ye reckon, suh, they&rsquo;d want to be
doing this same right now?&rdquo; came from Bob
White, in his soft Southern tones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yuh gits me thar, younker,&rdquo; replied the guide.
&ldquo;I dunno as how this heah sheriff he done been set
on tuh &rsquo;tempt this big job by the way people kept
anaggin&rsquo; o&rsquo; him. Yuh see, ever sense I kin remember
they been agwine tuh do this same thing, an&rsquo;
clean up Alligator Swamp; but as ther yeahs slipped
by it hain&rsquo;t neveh been &rsquo;tempted up tuh now. I
shore jest clean &rsquo;spected ole Tom Smith&rsquo;d neveh
live tuh see thet day. It looks like a miracle war
agwine tuh be kerried out, thet&rsquo;s what it does tuh
me. But we&rsquo;ll soon know all &rsquo;bout thet same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, because the dogs are certainly heading this
way,&rdquo; Thad added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knows every foot o&rsquo; ther ground, suh,&rdquo; continued
Tom; &ldquo;an&rsquo; guv yuh my word them hounds air
jest a follerin&rsquo; thet ridge yuh see right heah. Thar&rsquo;s
a brace o&rsquo; ther critters too, &rsquo;case I heard ther second
un jest now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the chances are that if we just lie on
our oars as we&rsquo;re doing now, we&rsquo;ll see the dogs,
and of course the sheriff&rsquo;s posse too, before long?&rdquo;
Allan observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hain&rsquo;t got tuh move a yard, suh; jest wait,&rdquo;
the other declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would we do if they just took a notion
to swim out to us, and climb aboard?&rdquo; Bumpus
wanted to know; as though that notion might be
causing him not a small amount of concern; doubtless
in imagination he could see a pair of ferocious
tan colored bloodhounds forcing their way into the
canoes, and snapping at the occupants most savagely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! we could poke the paddles down their
throats, and gag them both that way!&rdquo; Giraffe gaily
told him; for the tall scout did not take to forebodings
the same way as Bumpus, to whom small
things often looked serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not bothering my head about what the
dogs may do,&rdquo; Thad spoke up; &ldquo;but it is a matter
of some importance as to what their masters may
attempt. They&rsquo;re on the hunt for tough characters,
and of course hardly expect to run across a
party of Boy Scouts in the swamp. We must find
out some way to let them know we&rsquo;re friends, before
they start shooting at us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I hope we can do that same!&rdquo; muttered
Bumpus, much concerned. &ldquo;Even if they didn&rsquo;t
hit any of us, they might make the boats leak like
sieves; and I just know this black looking water
must be awful deep right here. Besides, who
wants to have to swim for it, with his clothes on,
and all them nasty wiggling moccasin snakes awaiting
to bite a fellow? Excuse me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As usual no one paid much attention to his wailing,
for they were accustomed to hearing Bumpus
suggest all sorts of queer happenings that were
hardly likely to come to pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you happen to know the name of this sheriff,
Tom Smith?&rdquo; Thad inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;I reckons as how I voted fo&rsquo; the same, an&rsquo;
orter know Hawkins Badgely,&rdquo; the other replied,
promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds good to me,&rdquo; Thad went on to
say. &ldquo;I always like to know the name of the man
I&rsquo;m up against; it often saves lots of time. Now,
when they get close up, you must call out at the
top of your voice, and address him as Sheriff
Badgely. Get that, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, suh, I does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he answers you,&rdquo; Thad continued, deliberately,
&ldquo;tell him to order his men not to shoot;
that you are with a party of boys exploring the
swamp, and would like him to come and join us.
Until we know more about what brings the sheriff
in here, perhaps we&rsquo;d be wise not to tell him too
much of our private business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ketches on tuh what yuh mean, suh; an&rsquo; I
shore thinks hit a smart dodge. Arter we-uns
finds out what fetches this heah posse &rsquo;round these
diggin&rsquo;s, we kin open up an&rsquo; tell what we thinks
best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long will it be before they reach us,
Tom?&rdquo; asked Giraffe, always impatient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yuh see the dorgs, they jest hes got tuh foller
ther ridges tuh we-uns, an&rsquo; I reckon as how it
mout be ten minits er so,&rdquo; the guide informed him,
after what seemed to be a rapid mental calculation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;And say, perhaps now, when this old moonshiner
hears the hounds, maybe he won&rsquo;t sit up and
take notice!&rdquo; exclaimed Davy, chuckling, as though
he had a personal grievance against Ricky, because
at the time the other fired that warning shot Davy
had been so quick to draw in his head, like a tortoise,
that he felt a stinging pain in the muscles of
his neck, which spot he had been rubbing ever
since.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll think the world is going to come to an
end, with seeing uniformed scouts in two boats,
and then the sheriff&rsquo;s posse coming. Listen, and
you can hear the men calling out to each other right
now, fellows!&rdquo; Step Hen observed.</p>
<p>Somehow the sounds seemed unusually strange;
for conditions go to make things loom up; and with
those weird surroundings on every hand the boys
could certainly find enough to imagine a mighty
thrilling spectacle.</p>
<p>Yes, the members of the big posse which the
energetic sheriff had summoned to make a clean
sweep of this pestiferous swamp hole, the hiding
place of every rascal for generations, were exchanging
calls, possibly between the boats and those
who followed the hounds on shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like there might be a lot of the same?&rdquo;
remarked Bumpus, after they had been listening
for several minutes; and without doubt the noisy
parties were coming nearer all the while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shore reckons as how the sheriff he wants
tuh make a clean sweep o&rsquo; hit this time,&rdquo; the guide
commented.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s been brought up in this parish he must
know Alligator Swamp is a pretty big affair, and
that if he wants to comb it all over, he&rsquo;s got to
have a little army of helpers,&rdquo; Thad went on to
say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder now, how they work them dogs?&rdquo;
Bumpus was heard to say, half to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! sometimes they keep the animals fast in
the leash,&rdquo; Allan told him, knowing what was
still worrying the fat scout; &ldquo;though there are occasions
when they have to let them run free. They
are trained to make a coon take to a tree; and
there they keep him until the posse comes along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if he just <i>won&rsquo;t</i> get up in a tree, or happens
to be too heavy to jump?&rdquo; inquired Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then he has to fight for it, because the
hounds will surely attack him, as they are pretty
savage,&rdquo; Giraffe hastened to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there are only two of &rsquo;em anyhow; an&rsquo;
I shot a great big grizzly onct, maybe you remember,
Giraffe,&rdquo; the other remarked, grimly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got a gun that can be depended on every time. All
you&rsquo;ve got to do is to aim straight, and pull the
trigger, and it does the rest,&rdquo; and Bumpus was
seen to be gripping his weapon while making these
truly ferocious remarks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; spoke up Thad, severely, &ldquo;none of
that, Bumpus. These dogs are on land, and they&rsquo;ll
not be apt to bother us one whit. No matter what
happens, don&rsquo;t you dare to think of firing a single
shot without I give the order. It would be rank
mutiny, and you know the penalty of that. If a
scout is alone, and has to act on his own initiative,
it&rsquo;s all very well; but when the scout-master is
along, every member of the patrol must look to him
for orders. Understand that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I do, Thad; and I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of
doing anything to get us in a peck of trouble with
this old sheriff; only, if I saw a dog trying to grab
Giraffe here, or Davy, by the neck, I&rsquo;d feel like
shooing him off, wouldn&rsquo;t I? Well, after he&rsquo;d give
&rsquo;em a little scare I would, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus relapsed into silence after that, though
it could be seen that he was very nervous, for he
kept bobbing up and down every little while.</p>
<p>Closer came the loud calls, until it became evident
that the sheriff&rsquo;s posse must be almost upon
them; for the hounds were now giving tongue just
beyond that fringe of scrub ashore, and they could
hear both the crackling of bushes and the splash
of several paddles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s about time you hailed the sheriff,
Tom Smith,&rdquo; remarked Thad, when he was convinced
that further delay might cause them trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jest as yuh sez, suh,&rdquo; replied the swamp guide,
as he raised his hands to his mouth to serve as a
megaphone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><span class="small">A SURPRISE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! Sheriff Badgely! Hello!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Tom Smith, the alligator-hide hunter,
sent this hail out at the top of his voice, it seemed
as though every other sound ceased like magic.
Why, even the hounds stopped yelping, and seemed
as though they might be standing there, sniffing
the air in their endeavor to locate the one who had
shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that callin&rsquo; me?&rdquo; a voice was heard to
say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, Sheriff, Alligator Tom Smith; I didn&rsquo;t
want yuh tuh be a takin&rsquo; a crack et me fust, an&rsquo; then
beggin&rsquo; my pardon arterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s it, hey? Whar are ye at, Tom?&rdquo;
came the sheriff&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out heah a space, in a boat. I done got a party
o&rsquo; No&rsquo;the&rsquo;n boys along with me, as wanted tuh see
what ole Alligator Swamp she looked like. Ef yuh
kim right &rsquo;long ther ridge, Sheriff, yuh cain&rsquo;t miss
us. We-uns&rsquo;d like tuh meet up with yuh right
smart. These heah boys they hain&rsquo;t never seen
dawgs like them yuh got.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Tom, we&rsquo;ll be &rsquo;long thar in a jiffy.
Glad ye spoke out when ye did, &rsquo;case some o&rsquo; my
men they like as not air ready to shoot at the sight
o&rsquo; a hat. Move along, Carson; hello, Mobbs, shove
the boats on, and jine us t&rsquo;other side o&rsquo; the p&rsquo;int.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the sound of voices, and also the fretting
of the hounds, could be heard, as the advance was
resumed. Then moving figures began to be seen
amidst the bushes ashore; while at the same time
several boats appeared in sight, turning the point
which had been mentioned by the energetic
sheriff.</p>
<p>Each boat had a number of men aboard, and all
of them seemed to be heavily armed, as though
they had not started out upon this undertaking
without recognizing the fact that they might run
across desperate characters, and be compelled to
show their teeth in armed conflict.</p>
<p>As the guide paddled in a little closer to the
shore so as to meet the officer when he arrived,
those in the other canoes did likewise; although
Bumpus viewed this movement with concern, doubtless
not being able to get those dogs out of his
mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got the hounds in leash right now,&rdquo;
he heard Thad remark presently; possibly the considerate
scout-master said this on purpose to ease
the minds of those who might be feeling a bit nervous;
at any rate it did comfort the fat member of
the patrol not a little, for he was immediately
heard to give vent to a sigh of tremendous volume,
and allow his rigid clutch upon the pistol-grip of
his gun to relax.</p>
<p>Thad had been prepared to see quite a numerous
retinue following the sheriff; but even he was surprised
at the multitude of men and boys who had
gladly accepted of the chance to have a hand in
the final cleaning up of the pest hole of the parish,
that had been postponed year after year until this
late day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, looks like a regular rag-tag army!&rdquo; Bumpus
was heard to mutter, as he stared at the Southern
planters, business men from near-by towns and
clerks in stores, all carrying guns of every possible
description, from the ancient musket, handed down
from Civil War times, to the modern repeating
pump-gun.</p>
<p>And if Bumpus and his mates stared hard at
the strange collection of butternut-clad natives,
fancy the way they were in turn gaped at by these
men and lads, most of whom had doubtless never
even heard of a Boy Scout, and knew not what to
make of their uniforms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>A small, nervous man came bustling forward, and
Thad, noting his air of authority, rightly guessed
that this must be the sheriff. And sure enough, he
wore a long coat just as the boys had noticed so
many of those wonderful Western sheriffs did in
the moving pictures they had watched, of stirring
scenes on the plains; while a wide-brimmed soft
hat sat jauntily upon his bushy head of red hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! Tom Smith!&rdquo; he called out, as he advanced;
&ldquo;I kinder expected to meet up with you
befo&rsquo; we got through with this job, but not so soon.
And, Great Jehosophat! what d&rsquo;ye call them boys
you&rsquo;ve got along? Is the militia been called out
to do my work fo&rsquo; me? I&rsquo;d like to know what all
this means, Tom Smith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sheriff was really showing signs of being
indignant, since he was supposed to be the peace officer
of the parish; and according to law, the soldiers
could not be called on duty until he had exhausted
his powers, and made a demand upon the
governor.</p>
<p>Of course the swamp hunter made haste to explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yuh see, suh, these is a party o&rsquo; No&rsquo;the&rsquo;n boys
as belong to the scouts. They kim down thisaway
on a matter o&rsquo; bizness, an&rsquo; wanted tuh see what a
reg&rsquo;lar Louisiana swamp she looked like. So I
&rsquo;grees tuh pilot &rsquo;em round a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean the Boy Scouts, Tom?&rdquo; demanded
the sheriff, eagerly; &ldquo;because, while we
ain&rsquo;t got so far along down heah as to have a
troop o&rsquo; the same, I know what they stand fo&rsquo;, an&rsquo;
I surely am glad to meet up with some o&rsquo; the lot.
If so be ye come ashore, I&rsquo;d like to shake hands
with ye, boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll count it a great honor, Mr. Sheriff,&rdquo;
said Giraffe, just as quick as he could speak, and
taking the words right out of Thad&rsquo;s mouth as it
were; but then it was an old trick with Giraffe, and
one he never could be cured of.</p>
<p>No one offered the slightest objection to paddling
close up to the land, and going ashore. Bumpus
was heard to mutter something to himself, however,
and might be expected to keep an anxious eye on
the two hounds that were straining at their rope
leashes, as though wanting to either go on, or else
make a closer acquaintance with these newcomers.</p>
<p>So the friendly sheriff proceeded to shake hands
all around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even down in this neck o&rsquo; the woods we done
heah more or less about what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on all over,&rdquo;
he remarked, as he came to Thad, in whom he
seemed to recognize the leader of the little band;
&ldquo;and I often thought I&rsquo;d like to meet up with some
o&rsquo; these heah Boy Scouts. I got the manual they
drill by, an&rsquo; it meets with my unqualified approval,
I wants to say right heah. I hain&rsquo;t got nary a boy,
but if my five gals was sech, I&rsquo;d want to start a
patrol right away in my town. An&rsquo; meetin&rsquo; you
chaps thisaway gets me more&rsquo;n ever in the notion
to try an&rsquo; see if we cain&rsquo;t have a troop o&rsquo; our own.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear you say that, Mr. Sheriff,&rdquo;
declared Thad; &ldquo;if you&rsquo;d care to take my address,
and I could do anything at all to help you in the
matter, you can depend upon it I will. You&rsquo;re
in something of a hurry just now, but perhaps later
on we may happen to meet again when things are
a little more quiet; and I&rsquo;d like to tell you dozens
of things that have happened to the Silver Fox
Patrol, that you&rsquo;d like to hear; and also what a big
difference it&rsquo;s made with some of our members.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s sure kind of you, my boy,&rdquo; said the
sheriff, while the crowd listened eagerly to all that
was being said, and some of the younger elements
began poking each other in the ribs, as though they
saw good times coming should the officer ever put
his contemplated plan into operation; for things
must have been pretty dull for boys down in that
region so far removed from the hurly burly of
metropolitan life. &ldquo;I hope now I&rsquo;ll meet up with
that chant, beca&rsquo;se there&rsquo;s a heap o&rsquo; things I&rsquo;d like
to ask you. But jest as you say, I&rsquo;m up to my
ears in business right now, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be just
the thing to pull up before this old swamp has been
run over east and west, no&rsquo;th and south, with a fine-tooth
comb, till we gits every law-breaker it hides,
or else chases &rsquo;em into the open, where they&rsquo;ll be
easy to corral.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tom Smith has been telling us considerable
about the way this place has been used for years
and years to hide runaway slaves, escaped convicts
from the camps, and all sorts of bad men; and
it&rsquo;ll be a blessing to the whole community, sir, if
you succeed in exterminating the vicious breed,&rdquo;
said Smithy, assuming his most important air.</p>
<p>Sheriff Badgely looked curiously at the speaker,
as though he did not exactly sense all that he said
in his pedagogue way; for Smithy was as exact in
his manner of speech as long ago he used to be
dudish in his dress, until the rougher element among
the scouts cured him of that fault.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank ye, son,&rdquo; the officer finally remarked,
thinking that this ought to cover the bill, and not
expose his ignorance concerning fine language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly does you credit, Mr. Sheriff, that
you&rsquo;ve undertaken a job which all your predecessors
seemed to have shirked,&rdquo; Allan went on to say;
for he had somehow taken a sort of sudden fancy
for the small man, who seemed to be as lively as a
cricket, and full of vim and go.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I might as well confess to ye, son,&rdquo; remarked
the sheriff with a chuckle; &ldquo;that p&rsquo;raps
I might a kept aputtin&rsquo; the raid off right along,
jest like Sheriff Zeb Coles done fo&rsquo; nigh on eleven
yeahs, till he turned up his toes and was put under
ground, only fo&rsquo; a certain thing happenin&rsquo;. Fact
is, they has been a big robbery up-country a bit,
an&rsquo; only two days back we got word as how the
man suspected o&rsquo; doin&rsquo; the same was a lyin&rsquo; low in
ole Alligator Swamp. Co&rsquo;se, after that thar wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
no excuse fo&rsquo; me not to raise a big posse, and try
to just clean things out down heah; &rsquo;case you see,
the man that had been robbed he offered to pay the
wages of every man and boy that&rsquo;d go along, and
put five thousand dollahs in my hand in addition, if
so be I was lucky enough to ketch thet slick thief,
an&rsquo; recover the stuff as had been taken from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see how that was a spur, just as you say,
sir,&rdquo; Thad remarked, smiling at the naive way in
which the officer admitted that the chances of a fat
reward made an alluring bait at any time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it gave me a chanct to collect the greatest
posse ever seen in these heah parts; an&rsquo; we&rsquo;re
just bound to have the biggest lot of fun afoah we
quits the game ever heard tell of,&rdquo; the sheriff went
on to say; &ldquo;but sorry to tell you, boys, we&rsquo;ll likely
have to part company right now, and take up our
hunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you come across anything in the way of
game so far?&rdquo; asked Giraffe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! we done sent that ole voodoo man to town
under guard,&rdquo; replied the other, carelessly; &ldquo;you
see, he&rsquo;s been makin&rsquo; heaps o&rsquo; trouble lately, gettin&rsquo;
some o&rsquo; the hands on the sugar plantations to
throwin&rsquo; up their jobs in the busy season, an&rsquo; fillin&rsquo;
&rsquo;em full o&rsquo; horrible notions sech as the voodoo practices.
And we kim to the conclusion that it had
to stop. He&rsquo;ll get sent where he won&rsquo;t do no more
damage in ignorant minds. Afore we-uns are
through with our job we calculate to pick up a number
o&rsquo; convicts that&rsquo;s been hidin&rsquo; out in this region;
but we&rsquo;ll try to devote most of our time and attention
to findin&rsquo; this heah slick Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the sheriff happened to casually mention
the man for whom all this remarkable preparation
had been made, Thad exchanged a quick glance
with his closest chum, Allan; for the officer who
was sworn to carry out the mandates of the law
had spoken the name of the party of whom the
scouts were in search, and who was believed by
Thad to be the kidnapper of his little baby sister,
Pauline, years before.</p>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><span class="small">JOINING FORCES.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Thad, did you hear what he said?&rdquo; whispered
Giraffe, in the ear of the scout-master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep still, Giraffe, and let me manage this affair,
please!&rdquo; was what Thad replied; and accordingly
the tall scout, quickly grasping the situation,
relapsed into silence; for he had the utmost
faith in the ability of the patrol leader to whip
things into shape.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;What was that you were telling us, Mr. Sheriff,
about this man robbing some one?&rdquo; Thad asked,
before the other could turn fully away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this way, son,&rdquo; came the obliging officer&rsquo;s
reply; &ldquo;a very wealthy planter by the name of
Richmond had occasion to employ a secretary to
conduct some literary work he was head oveh ears
interested in. So in New Orleans he comes across
a smart gentlemanly fellow who gives the name
of Jasper. Fo&rsquo; a long time they seem to get on
right well. Then all of a sudden the kunnel he
finds that his secretary suh, done disappeah, as also
the contents of his safe, includin&rsquo; some family
jewels that had been fetched oveh from France two
hundred yeahs ago by his ancestors, and which he
values above anything he possesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! and that is why he is willing to put up so
much money to try and recover these things, I
suppose?&rdquo; Thad went on, for the purpose of drawing
out still more information rather than because
he failed to understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That accounts fo&rsquo; the milk in the cocoanut,
son,&rdquo; the officer admitted. &ldquo;He then and there
calls me in fo&rsquo; a consultation, and immediately
afterwards issues that offer of reward, as also the
promise to pay every man and boy who would join
my posse, and hunt fo&rsquo; the thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then word came to you that some one had
seen a man answering the description of this Jasper
down here&mdash;was that it, sir?&rdquo; Allan asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have described it to the lettah, suh. And
as the thief must be hiding in Alligator Swamp,
you can understand how we&rsquo;ve made up our minds
to clean the old pest hole out, once fo&rsquo; all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we are told that a stranger never could
make his way in and out of here, because there are
so many treacherous passages; and that more than
a few men have met their death trying to escape
from the endless succession of watery trails?&rdquo; the
scout-master continued, still trying to pick up information
without betraying his side of the case
to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly correct, suh,&rdquo; the sheriff told him;
&ldquo;but that fact only made me look deeper into the
case. What do you think I discovered, but that
yeahs ago a family by the name of Jasper lived
close by this region. If that is so, then we sorter
reckons this heah thief might be a son of the ole
man; and in that case don&rsquo;t ye see, he&rsquo;d know every
part of the swamp as well as Tom Smith heah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It gave Thad a strange thrill to hear this spoken;
because had he not actually covered the identical
ground himself when figuring out just how the man
with the girl should be able to go and come with
such little concern?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he exclaimed, suddenly meaning to go
further, and learn more, if possible; &ldquo;seems to me
we heard something about a strange white man
who had been seen going into the swamp here, Mr.
Sheriff; and perhaps now it may have been the
same Jasper. But this party had a little girl about
ten years old with him. Was the Jasper you
wanted the father of such a child, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He done told the kunnel that he had a daughter
in a school in New Orleans; so p&rsquo;raps now he went
an&rsquo; took her out, so she could cook his meals fo&rsquo;
him all the time he was ahidin&rsquo;, till the trail got
cold, an&rsquo; it was safe fo&rsquo; him to head no&rsquo;th,&rdquo; was
what the sheriff told him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Thad had been quickly figuring in his
mind whether it would not be best for him to take
the officer wholly into his confidence; and being a
boy who could cut the Gordian knot, and decide
quickly on his plan of campaign, he immediately
settled this matter in the affirmative.</p>
<p>If the objective point of the sheriff&rsquo;s posse was
the retreat where Felix Jasper was supposed by
Tom Smith to be hidden, how foolish it would be
for them to try and attain their object while there
was a rival expedition in the field that might in
some way interfere with the successful carrying
out of their plans.</p>
<p>Yes, far better to combine, and pool their issues.
Besides, with such a formidable backing would not
success be more apt to perch upon their banners
than should they keep on trying it alone?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell you something, Mr. Sheriff,&rdquo;
he said, hastily; &ldquo;and while it may hold you up a
few minutes, in the end you&rsquo;ll admit that the time
has been profitably spent; because we might as well
join forces with you. Fact is, sir, we have come
all the way down from the North in the hope of
rounding up this same Jasper you&rsquo;re looking for;
because the girl he has with him, I have great reason
to believe, is my own little sister, stolen away
from my mother&rsquo;s home years ago by a man named
Felix Jasper, once from New Orleans, and who
wanted to have revenge upon the Brewster family
on account of some fancied wrong done him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course upon hearing this remarkable statement
the sheriff no longer evinced a nervous desire
to be on the go. He seemed to realize that his
interests were bound up with those of the manly
leader of the scouts, who had just thrilled him with
so strange a story.</p>
<p>And as for his posse, they were crowding around
so densely, anxious not to lose a single word of
what was said, that, as Giraffe afterwards declared,
they looked like &ldquo;sardines packed in a can;&rdquo; every
face filled with eagerness, and many of them seeming
hardly to breathe lest they lose some of the
story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>Thad, knowing that now he had broken the ice
it would be better to explain more fully, started in
to tell how his guardian received the news, and
could not himself undertake the long journey, but
had readily agreed that the scouts should come, because
they had shown themselves so capable on
many other occasions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We entered the swamp by ourselves, though I
understood it was a dangerous thing to attempt,&rdquo;
Thad concluded; &ldquo;but we were lucky enough to run
across a guide in Tom Smith here. He thinks he
can give a pretty good guess where this Jasper
will be apt to hold out, Mr. Sheriff; and now that
we&rsquo;re all on the same business, why not combine
forces, and let him show us the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A number of the planters and others exchanged
knowing glances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best thing that ever happened for us, Mr.
Sheriff!&rdquo; one man declared stoutly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truer words never were spoken,&rdquo; observed
another. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that Alligator Tom Smith
knows more things about this same swamp than any
man living. I told you in the beginning that we
had ought to hunt him up, and make him join the
posse. Luck is playing your way, Sheriff, believe
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer of the law seemed to think the same
way, for he immediately turned upon the scouts&rsquo;
guide and demanded:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are ye willin&rsquo; to come in with us, Tom, and
trust to me to make it right with ye, when I gets
that reward in my hands? &rsquo;Case if ye ain&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m
agoin&rsquo; to draft ye in the posse all the same, an&rsquo; ye
just cain&rsquo;t hold back. The State gives me that
power, ye understand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;ll let yuh set the price accordin&rsquo; tuh
how yuh sees fit,&rdquo; remarked the wise and far-seeing
Tom, quickly; if he had the name he might as well
have the game too, he undoubtedly thought; &ldquo;but
I hopes as how my employer heah, Mr. Scoutmaster,
won&rsquo;t go fo&rsquo; tuh think I purposely deserted
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re working for us just the same,
Tom,&rdquo; observed Thad, quickly; &ldquo;and your wages
will be going on all the time, no matter what you
get from our friend the sheriff. And so we may
call it settled; is that so, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as ye say, son; and I consider that I&rsquo;ve
certain got the best part o&rsquo; the bargain as it is,&rdquo;
the other replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t quarrel over the proceeds, for you
want to get the man and the stuff he stole; while
all we&rsquo;re after is the little girl,&rdquo; Thad went on to
say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure hopes it may turn out all right to you,
son, and the gal be thet same little sister you lost
long ago,&rdquo; the sympathetic sheriff went on to say;
&ldquo;I done got five gals, an&rsquo; I understand just what
it must have been fo&rsquo; your mammy to a lost her
on&rsquo;y one. Yes, we-all hopes as how you&rsquo;ll find
it ain&rsquo;t a mistake. But since these matters are
fixed, let&rsquo;s figure on headin&rsquo; that way, Tom Smith.
Now, what might ye advise, to begin with?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s thisaway, Sheriff,&rdquo; began the swamp-hunter;
&ldquo;dawgs is good in ther way; but sumtimes
they mout seem tuh git in ther road, an&rsquo; guv warnin&rsquo;
tuh theh party yuh was awantin&rsquo; tuh s&rsquo;prise.
Hain&rsquo;t thet so, suh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon ye knows best, Tom; an&rsquo; let me say
that I sees what yer drivin&rsquo; at,&rdquo; the officer told
him. &ldquo;Ye believes as ye knows whar this Jasper&rsquo;d
most likely be aholdin&rsquo; out, an&rsquo; ye kin take us thar
without the use of the hounds? Is that it, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close tuh what I war meanin&rsquo; tuh say, Sheriff,&rdquo;
the alligator hunter went on to remark; &ldquo;an&rsquo; if so
be now yuh kept the dawgs back heah a bit till we
seed if we cud round-up our man, it&rsquo;d be better.
Then, if he wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t whar I laid out tuh find him, yuh
cud call up the critters agin, an&rsquo; start in fresh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s settled, then,&rdquo; asserted the other; and
turning to one of the posse who seemed to be in
charge of the brace of hounds he continued:
&ldquo;Townley, ye heard as what was said, didn&rsquo;t ye?
Well, pick out another to help, and stay heah till
ye gets the signal to come on; or we-all joins ye
later.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>He spoke with such authority in his voice that
the man dared not evince any disposition to disobey,
though doubtless he secretly groaned in spirit
at being left out of the deal at such an important
juncture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Tom Smith, lead us on; everybody
keep quiet, and let&rsquo;s play this game fo&rsquo; all she&rsquo;s
worth. If so be we brings the critter to bay, they&rsquo;ll
be fightin&rsquo; in plenty, I reckons, if what the kunnel
says about this man is only half true. And in case
we have to take to the boats, p&rsquo;raps now some o&rsquo;
us&rsquo;ll be let crowd in with these plucky scouts. Fo&rsquo;
the last word, then, here&rsquo;s hopin&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll have the
best o&rsquo; success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The alligator-hide hunter again took the lead;
but now he had a following that must have given
him a strange thrill every time he turned his head
to glance backward, for quite a flotilla of boats
came in his wake; while on the nearby land a swarm
of figures flitted, reminding one somewhat of a
pack of silent wolves chasing relentlessly after a
wounded stag.</p>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX.
<br /><span class="small">THE SCOUTS SHOW THE WAY.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Thad!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>Step Hen leaned back in the boat he occupied
in company with Bumpus, Davy Jones and the
scout-master, as he softly uttered the name of the
last mentioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, what is it, Step Hen?&rdquo; remarked Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you mind if I asked a single question?&rdquo;
pursued the other, speaking as near a whisper as
he could, and still make his voice carry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, then,&rdquo; the other went on to say,
knowing full well that when once Step Hen&rsquo;s curiosity
became fully aroused there was nothing to
do but gratify it; besides, had he not often told
the scouts that a certain amount of &ldquo;wanting to
know&rdquo; was commendable?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I saw you talking with the sheriff just
before we started out again, and while you were
ashore; would it be a fair question to ask what you
fixed up with him?&rdquo; Step Hen inquired, boldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! nothing that would make any change in
our plans,&rdquo; said Thad. &ldquo;The fact is, I was a little
nervous about what might happen in all the excitement
of a fight; and it was only my plan to
get the sheriff to promise that he would warn every
man in the whole posse to be very careful not to
injure a hair of the girl&rsquo;s head, even by accident;
that&rsquo;s all, Step Hen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Thad, and I hope you don&rsquo;t think
I was putting in my oar where I had no business
to?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied the scout-master; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re
all chums, and I&rsquo;m certain that every one of you
feels almost as much interest as I do about meeting
up with this girl Jasper has with him, and learning
whether she can be our little Polly. But please
don&rsquo;t talk any more just now, Step Hen; because
it isn&rsquo;t best; and besides, I want to do some tall
thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither Bumpus nor Davy had taken any part in
this little whispered conversation but they had listened
eagerly, and doubtless caught every word that
was spoken; if one could judge from their manner,
and the great sigh that the fat scout managed to
heave when Thad brought the talk to an abrupt
close.</p>
<p>Yes, it was true that every member of the Silver
Fox Patrol did feel that he had a deep personal interest
in the outcome of this journey and search.
Thad was very dear to them all, and many times
they had pitied the boy because, outside of old
&ldquo;Daddy&rdquo; Brewster, his uncle and guardian, he
seemed to have no close relatives, while they all
had parents, and in most cases either brothers or
sisters, perhaps both.</p>
<p>Now, Thad was a sunny-natured lad, and not
given to complaining; yet these warm chums of
the Boy Scout Troop could remember instances
where tears had come into his fine eyes when visiting
at the home of some comrade around Christmas
time, and he seemed to realize what it was to
be without even one brother or sister, and lacking
the love and affection of father and mother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>And now that there really seemed a chance of
Thad&rsquo;s discovering a sweet little sister to love and
care for, every scout was praying pretty much continually
in his mind, that the expedition might not
turn out a failure, but that when they once more
turned their faces northward there would be an
addition to their number, and that Thad would be
smiling all the while with supreme happiness.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Tom Smith was leading them carefully
on.</p>
<p>It was entirely different now from what the advance
of the sheriff&rsquo;s posse had been before the
scouts met the crowd. Up to that time noise had
predominated, with the hounds baying wildly, and
men shouting back and forth, as though by this
means they expected to frighten the swamp fugitives
into surrendering.</p>
<p>Scout tactics now prevailed. When real woodsmen
start out to track an enemy, or even a wild
animal, they adopt the ways of the wolf or the
stealthy Indian, and keep utterly silent. Why, even
the paddles seemed to rise and fall with nothing
to mark their laboring save possibly the trickling
drip of drops of water falling from the elevated
blades; so careful were those who handled the same
how they used them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>Had they been trying to approach a feeding deer
on the edge of the water among lilypads the scouts
could not have exercised greater caution; and those
in the other boats, noticing how gently the boys
drove their canoes along, made haste to pattern
after them, not wishing to be outdone.</p>
<p>All the while the swamp was getting more and
more lonely looking, and the vegetation becoming
even thicker, showing that Alligator Smith must
be taking them to a part of the great morass where
few people ever came.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly he had his reasons for this, and
more than one of the scouts found himself nearly
bursting with eagerness to know what these could
be; but so long as the guide remained in the lead
there was no opportunity to put questions, even
could they muster up courage enough to attempt it.</p>
<p>Of course they were constantly on the alert, not
knowing at what moment there might come a change
in the conditions, and something not down on the
bills occur to break the monotony of the advance.</p>
<p>Some of them remembered what the sheriff had
said about this Jasper, and how, if all accounts
were true, there would be a wild time when they
finally rounded him up, as he would not succumb
without a desperate fight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>Bumpus watched the bushes and trees ahead of
the guide&rsquo;s boat. He was a great fellow to imagine
things, and doubtless had many a sudden start when
some bird stirred, or a small swamp animal scudded
away, each time causing poor nervous Bumpus to
imagine that it must be the terrible Jasper who was
hidden there, drawing a bead on the most prominent
object in the leading canoe behind that of the guide,
and which of course meant himself.</p>
<p>But then, try as he would he could not reduce his
bulk any more than had already been done; and so
he must continue to play the part of &ldquo;martyr,&rdquo; serving
as a shield to his three more fortunate chums
back in the boat.</p>
<p>The guide moderated his pace from time to
time. Bumpus wondered at first whether this came
from a fear lest he might be running into an ambush
cleverly set by the man in hiding; but after
watching more carefully he finally realized that he
was far from striking the truth when he thought
this way.</p>
<p>In fact, these periods of seeming hesitancy were
only indulged in when the men on the shore had
fallen somewhat behind; and undoubtedly it must
be Tom Smith&rsquo;s plan to allow them an opportunity
to come up again, so that the entire company might
be close together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>Finally Bumpus noticed that the guide was now
heading straight in toward the land, as though
he meant to give over the water part of the trip;
whereat the fat scout had a thrill of expectancy
and joy sweep over him; for once they left the
boats it would no longer be necessary for him to
stick there in the van, such a conspicuous object,
when by rights he felt much more at home in the
rear, letting such fire-eaters as Giraffe and Bob
White take the lead if they felt so inclined.
&ldquo;Every one to his taste,&rdquo; was the motto of Bumpus;
and as for him he always loudly declared that
Nature had not intended him to be a fighter, or
else would he have been fashioned on a different
model from that of a dumpling.</p>
<p>Yes, now Tom Smith had driven the prow of
his clumsy canoe right into the bank, and he was
clambering out of the same, showing that there was
about to be a positive change in the character of
the hunt.</p>
<p>A minute later and Bumpus was able to clamber
over the bow of his own boat, and actually reach
solid ground. How he drew in a great breath of
relief when this became an accomplished fact.
After all, give him the touch of good old <i>terra
firma</i>&mdash;how well he remembered going to the dictionary
to find out what those italicized words
meant when he first came across them in a story
of young plant hunters written by one who used
to be a great favorite among the boys several generations
past&mdash;Captain Mayne Reid, but who is
seldom known to the lads of to-day; and ever since
that time Bumpus had been prone to spring his
knowledge upon his unsuspecting fellow scouts, until
they threatened all sorts of dire things unless he
changed his tune.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>Still the very thought of &ldquo;solid ground&rdquo; must
always please a fellow built on the order of an elephant,
Bumpus told them time and again, as an excuse
for his satisfaction. However, he did not
dare open his mouth now to say a single word, and
had to take it out in sighing, and mentally shaking
hands with himself.</p>
<p>Presently they were all gathered there. The
boats were drawn up on the bank to be left in
charge of a guard, for it would not be very pleasant
if they returned later on, to find that some enemy
had been there, and either carried their canoes off,
or else in some way smashed holes in the bottoms,
so that they would be useless for the return trip.</p>
<p>The sheriff, Thad and Tom Smith came together
and talked for several minutes in low tones, the
rest gathering around, and trying to get in touch
with what was being said.</p>
<p>Had any one been noticing Davy very closely,
however, they might have seen him moving uneasily,
then withdrawing his eyes from the central
figures to look hurriedly around him; and after that
deliberately walking away so that he could place
himself on the <i>windward</i> side of the large group.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; grunted Bumpus, frowning when he
saw this, for he had by accident been pushing up
against Davy at the time, in his eagerness to hear
what the leaders were deciding on; &ldquo;think you&rsquo;re
smart, don&rsquo;t you? But I kinder reckon you&rsquo;re
overdoing the thing, and you&rsquo;ll get called down
good and hard by Thad, if you don&rsquo;t let me alone.
Huh! who cares, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus became aware about this time of the fact
that Tom Smith was no longer standing still, but
had begun to move off, as though meaning to lead
them on land the balance of the way.</p>
<p>He also seemed to keep close to the border of
the water, for some reason or other, as though
either the trail led there, or else he had some object
in not immediately plunging into the thick of the
scrub.</p>
<p>Before they had gone fifty yards this object was
made manifest. The guide carefully parted the
tall reeds that grew in the shallow water, and then
beckoned to the others to come forward and look
for themselves.</p>
<p>Of course the scouts were in the van, and they
quickly discovered what it was the swamp guide
wished them to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s only an old boat, after all!&rdquo; grumbled
Bumpus, who had possibly anticipated discovering
a monstrous alligator, or else the terrible Jasper
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, only a boat,&rdquo; added Allan, who was at
his elbow; &ldquo;but it belongs to the man we&rsquo;re looking
for, and tells us that we&rsquo;ll find him home, when we
get to where he hangs out; for that&rsquo;s the means he
has of coming and going. Things look good to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><span class="small">ON THE TRAIL.</span></h2>
<p>Tom Smith looked as though he were himself
rather pleased over his find. Thad had an idea that
the swamp guide had been basing a part of his
plans on some theory he had formed; and was
tickled to discover how well it had turned out.</p>
<p>Under his directions a guard was also set over
the boat, with orders to remain in hiding, but constantly
ready to spring upon the hunted party, in
case he should manage to elude the main body,
and make his way to the secret hiding-place of his
boat, with the intention of fleeing from the swamp.</p>
<p>And when all these little arrangements had been
completed, Tom Smith passed to the other side
of the sedge grass, and showed them what seemed
to be a sure-enough trail, leading directly into the
scrub, and undoubtedly only recently made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait up for just a minute or so, will you,
Tom?&rdquo; said Thad; and while the boy did not go
further in order to explain what he wished to do,
when the other scouts saw him move hastily along,
and drop down on his hands and knees beside the
trail, somehow they just seemed to instinctively
guess what was in his mind and heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>Thad was looking for the track of <i>little feet</i>
there; such as would betray the fact that a child had
accompanied the man when he passed to and fro
from the boat to the secret hiding-place!</p>
<p>All of them fairly held their breath while waiting
to hear the result of the scout-master&rsquo;s investigation.
They knew what his ability was in the
line of reading &ldquo;signs,&rdquo; and felt no hesitation about
believing that if any one present could discover
the impression of the girl&rsquo;s shoes in the soil, Thad
would.</p>
<p>He got up presently, and those who had seen him
almost tenderly touch the ground in certain places
with his hand, knew before he said a word that his
search had certainly met with abundant success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he has the girl along with him,&rdquo; Thad
went on to say, softly, noticing the anxious faces
of his chums; &ldquo;and so far as that goes, the story
that was sent up North was true. But then, we
will have to wait a little before we know whether
she is really his daughter or&mdash;little Polly!&rdquo; and
his voice was very tender as he just softly breathed
that name which had been almost constantly in his
mind of late.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>The sheriff had drawn near the guide, and seemed
desirous of learning something more about the
expected hiding-place of the fugitive from justice;
and thus having his hands doubly strengthened for
the anticipated fray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us a leetle more about it, Tom,&rdquo; he urged;
&ldquo;how did ye ever come to think Jasper he&rsquo;d be a
keepin&rsquo; undeh cover heah; and what does it look
like? We-all ain&rsquo;t agoin&rsquo; to get a chanct to talk
agin, I reckons, an&rsquo; let it all be said an&rsquo; done now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guide did not seem to be unwilling to rest
a bit before starting out on the last leg of the
&ldquo;closing-in&rdquo; process. And no doubt he quite
agreed with the sheriff in what the other said about
the man who was forewarned being doubly armed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yuh see, Shurff,&rdquo; he began, softly, &ldquo;I
done took consid&rsquo;able int&rsquo;rest in everything &rsquo;bout
this heah ole swamp; an&rsquo; when I fust cotch theh
story &rsquo;bout theh Jasper fambly, I investigates, an&rsquo;
larns how a cupple o&rsquo; theh boys used tuh hide out
in the swamp days at a time, when theh ole man
he was riled at &rsquo;em, an&rsquo; nobody ever cud find out
whar they stayed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see that same just got your spunk up,&rdquo; remarked
the officer with a grin, &ldquo;and ye was detarmined
ye&rsquo;d find it out fo&rsquo; y&rsquo;self, eh, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;W&rsquo;ich I did afore I was satisfied,&rdquo; continued
the other, &ldquo;an&rsquo; we&rsquo;en I larned as how a Jasper hed
kim back, tuh disappear like to Alligator Swamp,
w&rsquo;y, don&rsquo;t yuh see, I jest nat&rsquo;rally concludes as
how he must be one o&rsquo; them as used to play hide an&rsquo;
seek thar. So I reckons I&rsquo;d know whar tuh find
theh same; an&rsquo; arter runnin&rsquo; acrost that ole boat
whar we did, I hain&rsquo;t any doubts &rsquo;bout hit. He&rsquo;s
thar, as sure&rsquo;s my name&rsquo;s Thomas Beauregarde
Smith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tell us somethin&rsquo; about the nest, now,&rdquo;
urged the sheriff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This heah trail&rsquo;ll lead us plumb thar, see if she
don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; remarked the guide, wagging his head with
conviction. &ldquo;Yuh see, tuh git tuh the place it&rsquo;s
fust necessary tuh cross a big bed o&rsquo; muck whar a
sunken ridge lies. I had tuh <i>feel</i> my way acrost
mighty keerful; &rsquo;cause if yuh takes a wrong step
chances are yuh&rsquo;ll be up tuh yuh waist in mud; an&rsquo;
if so be thar hain&rsquo;t nobody &rsquo;round thet section tuh
lend yuh a helpin&rsquo; hand yuh kin make up yuh mind
it&rsquo;s the end. I seen quicksand sum in my time,
but they ain&rsquo;t a sarkimstance alongside that muck
fo&rsquo; suckin&rsquo; yuh in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus tightened his fists as he heard this stated.
He seemed to have a sudden inspiration, or fear,
and it was to the effect that if any single person
in all that host were unlucky enough to slip from
that concealed ledge, and test the depth of that
muck bed, he would be the wretched victim&mdash;was
it not always the case that he had to play the part
of the &ldquo;goat&rdquo; in any performance?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;But once over thet bad part an&rsquo; the rest is
easy sailin&rsquo;, Shurff,&rdquo; the guide went on to say, confidently,
&ldquo;fo&rsquo; yuh see, they&rsquo;s a sorter wooded island
thar; an&rsquo; outside o&rsquo; them Jasper boys an&rsquo; me, I
done reckon as how nobody ever did find theh way
tuh git oveh thar. All I asks yuh is tuh keep right
still till we kin kinder s&rsquo;round theh shack an&rsquo; s&rsquo;prise
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there is some sort of house, is there?&rdquo;
asked Thad, thinking again of the little girl, and
what a cover over her head might mean in wet
weather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I allow as thar be, suh; leastwise &rsquo;twar thar
w&rsquo;en I larst been oveh. You see, it happens as
how the &rsquo;gators they don&rsquo;t use thet island, frum
sum cause er other, an&rsquo; so I neveh keered tuh stay
thar any time; so it&rsquo;s ben sum yeahs sense larst I
crossed. But I hain&rsquo;t forgot theh way, I reckons,
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll guide yuh thar, safe an&rsquo; sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to heah ye say that, Tom,&rdquo; remarked the
sheriff: &ldquo;and fo&rsquo; the sake of this heah fine boy I
sure hopes that we&rsquo;ll find his sister, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Thad, turning his eyes toward
the officer, with a feeling of gratitude in
that Fortune had raised up such a sympathetic
friend just when they were in need of help; &ldquo;you
can be certain that I&rsquo;m hoping all the while the
same way. When we get back to town I&rsquo;ll find
letters there from my uncle, and begging me to
wire him how it has come out; and I trust that the
news I send will be just the one word: &lsquo;Found!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>&ldquo;And as for me,&rdquo; Bumpus was heard to say,
softly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m also hoping to get a letter in answer
to the one I wrote my ma on the way down, asking
her if I&rsquo;d delivered that medicine she sent me for.
Hope to goodness the answer is &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; because it&rsquo;ll
be a turrible load off my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five cents&rsquo; worth of worry, and you&rsquo;d think it
spelt ten thousand dollars!&rdquo; jeered Giraffe; but
he was careful to say this in the ear of the stout
scout, for he did not want Thad to know he was
still keeping up this badgering process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for the amount, and you know
that,&rdquo; said Bumpus, in an irritable fashion that was
strange for him, but might be laid to the cold in
the head from which he had now been suffering
for several days; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just the <i>principle</i> of the
thing that hurts me. My honor as a scout is in
question. I hate to think of having failed the only
mother I&rsquo;ve got, when she trusted and depended
on me. Get that, do you, Giraffe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! sure, only how many mothers would you
expect to have?&rdquo; the other went on; but Bumpus,
having had his say, relapsed into a dignified silence.</p>
<p>Thad had taken his position alongside the guide
when they started out again. As they now had a
trail to follow there was no longer any necessity
for depending on the knowledge of Tom Smith,
and his broad acquaintance with the intricacies of
the swamp. Left to themselves the scouts could
have easily carried the expedition safely along from
this point; for they were well versed in the secrets
of woodcraft.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>And as he walked along by the side of Alligator
Smith the scout-master kept his fond gaze fastened,
a part of the time, upon every fresh indentation of
those heels belonging to the shoes of the girl who
was in the company of the fugitive, Jasper.</p>
<p>What hopes and fears must be passing constantly
through the mind of Thad as he contemplated those
dainty footprints. Many and many a time had he
yearned to be as well off as some of his chums, in
the way of having some one near and dear to him,
whom he could love and protect; and now that there
seemed a possible chance of a little sister being
miraculously given to him through the working of
Fate, the boy could hardly believe that he was not
dreaming.</p>
<p>At the same time he did not forget his scout
schooling, and that he must always be on the alert.
So from time to time he would take his eyes away
from the faint trail ahead, to scan the bushes, and
seek for any sign that might spell danger.</p>
<p>When a lesson has been well learned it soon becomes
what might be called &ldquo;second nature;&rdquo; and
so Thad, even in the present excited condition of
his mind, could not help acting as he believed a
sagacious scout should when on duty, and following
in the wake of a dangerous man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>Perhaps it was a good thing he kept himself
on the alert, for while Tom Smith was a woodsman,
and might have seen what attracted the attention
of the scout-master, there could be no telling.
And had it not been discovered, they might
have found what Giraffe would call &ldquo;rougher sledding&rdquo;
later on.</p>
<p>They happened to be in a particularly thick patch
of scrub and woodland where Thad felt more than
half convinced that if the fugitive had thought to
lay any sort of trap the springing of which would
give him warning of the coming of enemies he must
have chosen this place; when he made a little discovery
that caused him to instantly clutch the arm
of Tom Smith, and say softly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Others of the party gripped their guns, and
looked eagerly around, under the impression that
Thad must have sighted a hovering figure back of
some tree; and no doubt half expecting to hear
the crash of a gun break the silence that hung over
the spot. But nothing of the kind came to pass.
Instead, Thad drew the guide several steps along,
and then pointed to the brush close at their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what d&rsquo;ye think of that?&rdquo; Bumpus remarked,
as he pushed forward the better to see;
&ldquo;if he hasn&rsquo;t put an old rope across the path just to
trip us up, and make all the trouble he can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe looked scornfully at the fat scout.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>&ldquo;Think so, do you, Bumpus?&rdquo; he remarked, with
a lofty sense of his own sagacity. &ldquo;Well, if you
happened to trip over that same rope, chances are
now you&rsquo;d hear a gun go off. P&rsquo;raps the load
<i>might</i> miss you, though I don&rsquo;t see how anything
could do that; but all the same, the bang of the
gun&rsquo;d tell Mr. Jasper it was time he took to the
woods, and ran like a scared rabbit. So you see
what Thad&rsquo;s shut off by his find.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><span class="small">THE MAN-TRAP.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Seems like it took a scout to do the job, and
make such an important discovery!&rdquo; Step Hen
hastened to remark, apparently proud of the fact
that he too wore that magical khaki uniform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where&rsquo;s the gun, I don&rsquo;t see?&rdquo; demanded
Bumpus, who seldom allowed himself to wholly
believe things, until he understood all the details,
for he could be very practical when he wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch Thad, and you&rsquo;ll know,&rdquo; Giraffe told
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>Thad was bending down, and to all appearances
examining the stout cord that had been drawn
directly across the trail, mostly hidden by the low
scrub. It had been arranged by a master-hand at
cunning, and was just high enough to make certain
that a careless foot would strike against it, bringing
about the immediate result that the one who
had placed it there contemplated.</p>
<p>Without even touching the cord the young scoutmaster
commenced to follow it along, foot by foot.
The sheriff&rsquo;s posse, including Alligator Smith, the
swamp guide, stood there and just watched to see
what he would do. Somehow all of them seemed
to have taken a strange liking for the patrol leader.
Perhaps it was his manly bearing that made Thad
friends so quickly; while the errand that had
brought him down to Dixieland may have had more
or less to do with it; for the hearts of these Southern
boys and men are always tender toward one
who has suffered; and chivalry toward women and
girls still abounds in the South as it can be found
nowhere else in this broad land of ours.</p>
<p>But then that was an old story with Giraffe and
the rest of the fellows; ever since Thad Brewster
had come to Cranford and entered into their sports
they had been accustomed to seeing him make new
and warm friends as though he might be a wizard.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the scout was apparently nearing
the spot upon which his attention had been centered.
It was only a dozen or so feet away from the trail
and seemed to be where three trees grew up in a
queer clump, being shoots of a former swamp king
among the oaks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>Here Thad paused and bent still lower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s struck ile!&rdquo; one of the posse was heard
to say to a companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon as haow he hes, Jed,&rdquo; another went on
to remark.</p>
<p>Bumpus stared as best he could, and waited impatiently
to see what would be the result of Thad&rsquo;s
search. He held his breath so long, through eagerness,
that his face grew furiously red; and one of
the posse even moved a little further away from
the fat boy, possibly under the vague suspicion that
he was about to have a fit; or from some other reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully for Thad!&rdquo; Giraffe was heard to say, a
little louder than discretion might have dictated; at
least Allan gave him a nudge in the back, which the
tall scout understood to mean &ldquo;less noise, there!&rdquo;
for he cut his exultant ejaculations short, and
wilted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sure-enough gun!&rdquo; admitted Bumpus,
giving a sort of whistle as he allowed his breath to
flow evenly again; just as you may have heard the
hydrant do when there is air in the pipe, and the
water has been turned on or off suddenly.</p>
<p>But then all of them had already made sure of
that same fact, even if they did not think it necessary
to announce it in the same way the fat scout
did.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>Thad came back to where they were grouped,
awaiting him, and holding in his hand the gun he
had unfastened from amidst the three saplings,
where some one had secured it, with the muzzle
pointing straight toward the spot at which the
trail was crossed by that concealed cord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a sure enough man-trap!&rdquo; Davy remarked,
in considerable awe, as he noted that the
hammer of the old gun was still drawn back, as
though ready to be discharged with the slightest
pull.</p>
<p>Bumpus noticed that there still hung from the
trigger a foot or so of that cord and from this he
judged Thad must have just drawn the blade of his
knife gently across the taut line; as the scout-master
was very particular to always keep his hunting
knife in perfect condition, the edge of the blade was
as keen as a razor, and would sever that cord without
the slightest influence upon the gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that was a smart dodge, all right!&rdquo; the
Dixie sheriff remarked, admiringly, as Thad handed
him the gun, which seemed to be an old musket,
such as several of the posse were even then carrying,
and which had perhaps played its part during
those troublous times many years back, when the
yankee horde invaded Southern pastures, and gradually,
through force of numbers, drove the gallant
Confederates to the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it was aiming right this way, Thad?&rdquo;
remarked Step Hen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if any one of us had been silly enough to
drag that cord with our feet, the gun would have
been fired, and whatever it contains must have
come this way, with more or less painful results,&rdquo;
the other informed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! looks to me like it&rsquo;d hold just about a
pint of bullets, old nails or anything else that&rsquo;s
calculated to give trouble,&rdquo; said Davy, as he respectfully
touched the rusty old weapon that Jasper
must have fetched along especially for the purpose
to which it had been put.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; Thad continued, &ldquo;you can see how he
expected it to serve two purposes; for besides standing
a chance of wounding some one when it went
off, the gun would give him warning, and he could
have time to escape. It was a clever trick, and
shows us what sort of smart rascal we&rsquo;re looking
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An I wanter say right heah,&rdquo; remarked Alligator
Smith, frankly; &ldquo;thet it&rsquo;s all owin&rsquo; tuh them
sharp eyes o&rsquo; yourn we ain&rsquo;t riddled afore now by
the shot er bullets as mout be in this yer gun; &rsquo;case
I admits as how I never sot out tuh look to&rsquo; any
sech contraption in ther grass er brush; an&rsquo; chances
air I&rsquo;d gone stumblin&rsquo; right acrost, so as tuh draw
thet trigger, an&rsquo; upset theh fat in theh fire, even
if I war lucky enuff tuh &rsquo;scape gettin&rsquo; plugged myself.
Arter this I&rsquo;m agwine tuh larn more &rsquo;bout
scouts an&rsquo; sech. Seems like they knows ther bizness;
an&rsquo; even a ole swamp hunter like me kin larn
somethin&rsquo; frum theh same.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; said Giraffe; but he knew Allan
was standing close beside him, and not feeling like
drawing another stiff dig in the ribs as a reproof,
he just whispered the one word, while pretending
to clap his hands; for these boys were justly proud
of their calling, and could never hear words of
praise uttered for scout-craft without a personal
sense of satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s one game failed, anyway!&rdquo; Bumpus
was heard to say, half to himself, as though in
imagination he was thus decreasing the perils that
he expected were lying in wait along their course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll all fall before us, see if they don&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
Davy Jones went on to say, as though his confidence
had grown by leaps and bounds, and had reached a
final stage when he saw Thad nip the plot of the
enemy so neatly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometime I&rsquo;d just like to take the trouble to
draw the load he put in that old musket,&rdquo; Step Hen
told Smithy, who was close to his elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever good would that do you?&rdquo; asked the
other, who could not understand why any one could
allow his curiosity to make him so much unnecessary
work; for while Smithy had reformed in
many ways, he still &ldquo;shirked&rdquo; a little, Thad had
often noticed, for he had never been shown the delight
of <i>doing things</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you understand that it might give
a fellow a certain amount of satisfaction to know
what a narrow escape he had?&rdquo; asked the other.
&ldquo;Suppose now, I was to extract seven bullets, sixteen
rusty nails, a couple of marbles, four screws
and a few other things I just can&rsquo;t think of, from
that old cannon, wouldn&rsquo;t the sight of the lot make
me gladder than ever that Thad found it out in
time; and that we didn&rsquo;t get that wagon-load of
stuff turned in on us, backed by six drams of black
powder? Smithy, you ain&rsquo;t got any idea of being
thankful over things. Just however would you
be able to keep on talking in that stilted lawyer-like
way you&rsquo;ve got, if a nail had knocked a bunch of
teeth out&mdash;tell me that, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw! keep still, there, Step Hen, this ain&rsquo;t the
place for arguments like that. Just wait till we&rsquo;ve
got to the end of the trail, and then some!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strange to say it was neither Thad nor Allan
who took the trouble to admonish the talkative
scout in this fashion, but Giraffe himself. Since
he was debarred from giving <i>his</i> opinion by the
proximity of Allan and his ready hand, the tall
member of the patrol evidently thought that he
could at least find some satisfaction by passing the
reproof along; since misery likes company.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>But all the same, while Step Hen did relapse into
silence after being told so plainly that he had no
business to air his views, he took especial pains to
notice where Thad laid the old rusty musket down
in a clump of brush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! reckon I could find that place again,
easy,&rdquo; the boy was telling himself in confidence;
&ldquo;and I will, too, if everything passes off comfy,
and we get our man. Guess there ain&rsquo;t much danger
of our missing connections there, with such a
bully mob to surround the place, and fellows like
our Thad to think up things. I want to just show
Smithy what there is in that gun, and s&rsquo;prise him,
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now that the trail could be followed once more
without much danger of another man-trap, Thad
and the swamp-guide were again starting out;
though the latter before taking a step had made
sure to add further warning to what he had already
said about every one keeping as still as possible.</p>
<p>Really there was little need of saying that, for
it was easy to see from the set looks on all those
faces how the men and boys were alive to the occasion,
and not likely to risk spoiling the surround
by any incautious move, or loud unnecessary talk.</p>
<p>One thing at least favored them a little. This
was the breeze, which seemed to be blowing directly
in their faces. Thus any sounds they might happen
to make would not be carried ahead, as would
have been the case should they have been traveling
<i>down</i> the wind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>This probably came about by sheer accident;
but all the same it was noticed by those of the
scouts who were woodsmen enough to pay attention
to small things; and of course Thad and the swamp-hunter
had known of it all along.</p>
<p>The boys presently realized that they must be
close upon the broad slough spoken of by Tom
Smith, when he declared that the sunken ridge
which must be followed was the only way he knew
about whereby passage might be effected, so as to
reach the higher island wooded beyond; though he
had at the same time admitted that Jasper might
have some other means for escaping if hard pressed,
discovered when, as a boy, he frequently visited this
section of the swamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she is!&rdquo; muttered Giraffe, and Bumpus,
hearing the low words, raised his eyes from
the ground, to stare ahead at the prospect facing
them.</p>
<p>It did not require any particular knowledge of
woodcraft to proclaim that what the elongated
scout had remarked was quite true, for the dreadful
bog might have no substantial bottom short of
a hundred feet, was before them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>It looked bad to Bumpus, stretching away for
several hundred yards to where the trees again
grew heavily on solid ground. The ooze was deceptive.
It had a green scum on the surface in
places, as though some verdure had taken root, but
in all probability had any one ventured to trust his
weight upon such deceptive spots he must have
speedily found himself immersed in muck up to his
knees, or worse, and unable alone and unaided to
ever keep himself from sinking gradually deeper
and deeper, until it was over his head.</p>
<p>Bumpus shivered as he looked. It was as though
he felt in his very bones that an unkind fate destined
him to make the test as to whether the bad
name given to this bog were well deserved, or not.</p>
<p>As they stood there on the edge looking out,
while the alligator hunter was making sure that he
knew exactly where to enter the muck bed, so as
to feel out the sunken roadway that wound in zig-zag
fashion over to the island, good-natured Bob
White felt some one poke him in the side.</p>
<p>Looking down he saw the solemn face of Bumpus
there; and there was an expression of almost
pitiful appeal in the eyes of the fat scout, such as
the Southern boy remembered once noticing in the
brown orbs of a deer he had wounded, and which
had to be put out of its misery.</p>
<p>But then of course he did not anticipate that
Bumpus was going to ask him to do the merciful
thing by him, and end his sufferings; though he understood
plainly enough that the stout scout was
enduring some sort of agony of mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will you do me a favor, a great favor, Bob,
<i>please</i>?&rdquo; Bumpus whispered, looking quickly around
at the same time, as though wishing to make sure
that neither Davy nor Giraffe were close enough to
overhear what he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure I will, Bumpus,&rdquo; quickly replied the
other; &ldquo;anything within reason you can count on
me doing, suh. I believe in scouts standing by
each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! thank you, Bob; it&rsquo;s kind of you to say
that,&rdquo; Bumpus went on, as he tried to thrust something
into the hand of the other. &ldquo;Please take
this, and if it does happen, pull like everything; because
I&rsquo;m heavy, you know, and chances are I&rsquo;d sink
quicker&rsquo;n any of the rest of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;this is a piece of heavy cord, Bumpus, perhaps
the same that was stretched across the trail a
little while ago?&rdquo; exclaimed the astonished Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, I was quick to see how I might
use it, for scouts are expected to keep their brains
moving all the time. You see,&rdquo; continued Bumpus,
confidingly. &ldquo;I just feel it in my bones that I&rsquo;ll
be the one to miss connections with that crazy old
hidden path, and fall slap into the mud, and I&rsquo;ve
got the other end tied under my arms; so in case
you hear a splash, be ready to hold tight, Bob.
That&rsquo;s a good fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><span class="small">AN ANCHOR TO WINDWARD.</span></h2>
<p>When Bob White heard Bumpus talk in this way
he took notice of the fact that the stout scout was in
deadly earnest in what he said. It was no laughing
matter, apparently, because Bumpus had evidently
made all sorts of preparations for the expected disaster,
besides fastening one end of that cord around
his body, and asking his fellow scout to hold the
other.</p>
<p>His precious silver-plated bugle which, as the accredited
musician of the troop, he always carried
along with him, unless otherwise forbidden by Thad,
he had now made more secure against possible damage
by fastening the same about his neck, so that it
dangled between his shoulders. And he was gripping
his rifle as though bent on keeping that also out
of the awful muck, should the accident he anticipated
come to pass; for once let any of that ooze
find a way into the barrel, and it would be a most
difficult task to get the interior &ldquo;spic-and-span,&rdquo;
and shiny again, as Bumpus always wished to keep
his firearm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>But Bob White did not smile.</p>
<p>He liked the fat boy too well to give him unnecessary
pain, though the fact of Bumpus preparing that
heavy cord so that he might be saved in time,
should he slip from the narrow causeway and sink
into the slime, was really comical; and later on
would doubtless elicit roars of laughter from unfeeling
Giraffe and Davy, when they came to talk
matters over, and were free to make as much noise
as they felt like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Bumpus,&rdquo; Bob said, reassuringly,
as he accepted the cord, and proceeded to
wind it several times around his left hand, for he
was carrying his gun in his right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do me the favor, then, will you?&rdquo; questioned
the other, with eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure I will, suh, and only too gladly,&rdquo;
replied Bob; &ldquo;but, if so be you happen to know
when you&rsquo;re going, it might be a good thing, I take
it, to give me due warning of the same, because a
sudden jerk would perhaps pull me over with you;
and then, suh, it&rsquo;d be a case of the blind leading the
blind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, Bob, depend on it, I&rsquo;ll try to,&rdquo; Bumpus
assured him. &ldquo;Course I don&rsquo;t want to souse in that
awful mud, and I&rsquo;m agoing to try my level best to
keep on the straight and narrow road all I can; but
if it does happen, it&rsquo;s always some comfort to know
you&rsquo;ve got an anchor out to windward.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, suh, it&rsquo;s sometimes a good thing to have
a string tied to things, so they can be jerked back if
the conditions don&rsquo;t seem favorable. I&rsquo;ve known
fellows who never made a bargain but they had an
&lsquo;if&rsquo; or a &lsquo;perhaps&rsquo; fixed to the same. But nobody
could say that of you, Bumpus. Don&rsquo;t worry about
me; I&rsquo;ll attend to business at the old stand, suh, all
right. You won&rsquo;t go down so quick but that I&rsquo;ll
manage to draw the line taut; and if she holds you&rsquo;re
just bound to come out, either whole or in sections,
suh. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which intelligence could hardly have been very
comforting to poor Bumpus; whose face took on a
thoughtful look, as though he had begun already to
wonder whether the remedy might not be more
dreadful than the disease.</p>
<p>But there was no time for more conversation in
these whispered tones between the two scouts; because
Alligator Smith had apparently found the
place for which he was looking, and boldly stepped
out from the firm ground.</p>
<p>While his feet went under the surface an inch or
so, he seemed to have struck a solid foundation;
for he immediately turned, and waved his hand to
the posse; and then held up his finger suggestively,
as though warning them under no circumstances
should they make unnecessary noise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>Perhaps the fox they hoped to find in his hole
might be sleeping, and not apt to take the alarm
easily; but it was not wise to depend too much upon
that chance. The really keen woodsman never underrates
the party or animal he may be hunting,
but always acts as though he must expect the worst.
It is better to be too cautious than to lack in this
regard, and ruin well-laid plans.</p>
<p>Pretty soon there was a long line of men and
boys making their way along that submerged ledge
of solid ground. Thad came immediately after the
guide, walking in the footprints of the swamp
hunter, if such a thing could be said where the soft
ooze instantly settled back as soon as one withdrew
his foot. Then others of the scouts, led by the
sheriff, trailed along, Bumpus being just behind his
good friend Bob White, so no one really noticed
that there was a connecting link between the two.</p>
<p>By the time the last member of the big posse had
entered the bog, Alligator Smith was almost halfway
over; and thus far all had gone smoothly, so
that save for a certain amount of soft splashing
there had nothing happened to create a disturbance.
Bumpus was going strong. He must feel more or
less encouraged by the success with which he was
following in the wake of Smithy, who evidently felt
this thing of soiling his brand new leggings with
that black ooze more than any other scout; because
Smithy never could get over being particular in his
appearance, though he had been cured of being a
dude, brushing his hair when in camp, and other
silly ways of trying to imagine that certain duties
must be performed when roughing it, just the same
as when he was at home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>Bumpus kept his eyes glued upon the feet of
Smithy, knowing that eternal vigilance was always
the price of safety and liberty. If the other manifested
signs of wabbling Bumpus was apt to shudder,
and stand stock-still until he saw Smithy go on
again without taking the anticipated tumble into
that quaking muck bed that seemed to just yawn
expectantly on either side of the moving line of men
and boys.</p>
<p>Some persons declare that when one is anticipating
a thing it generally comes about. Others say a
&ldquo;watched kettle never boils;&rdquo; so you can take your
choice. But as events proved, Bumpus&rsquo; fears were
not without a foundation; for when he was all of
two-thirds of the way over the bog he suddenly
slipped, and losing his footing, just settled into the
ooze like a big balloon might drop down.</p>
<p>Bumpus gave no yelp of alarm, for he had kept
schooling himself on this score all along, and made
up his mind that if the sacrifice must be carried out
he would at least prove himself a credit to the training
of Thad, and go down in silence.</p>
<p>Bob White came very near being pulled in after
him; but Giraffe who came just behind the Southern
boy, succeeded in clutching him in time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>There was poor Bumpus over his knees in the
slime, and sinking steadily all the while on account
of his great weight. He knew the futility of trying
to get out by himself, and that the more he moved
about the worse his plight was bound to be; and so
he just squatted there like a huge frog, holding his
gun up above his head, and looking appealingly
toward the chum from whom he felt that he had a
right to expect help.</p>
<p>Nor was Bob White slow to get busy on that line.
Fortunately it was a new and strong cord that
Jasper had used in his man-trap which failed to
work because of the vigilance of the scout-master;
and when several others had laid hold of the same
no doubt they could assist Bumpus to clamber out
again.</p>
<p>It was rather difficult to accomplish anything
while on such a narrow footing, because in the first
place they could not bunch together; and then again
there was always a chance that one of the other
scouts might also lose his footing, and slide into
that soft bed; for the muck was no respector of
persons, neither did Bumpus have a monopoly of
the same, because there was plenty of room for
others.</p>
<p>But by dint of judicious handling, and a sort of
swinging pull they managed to start the heavy
scout coming.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get a move on, and help yourself, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
fretted Giraffe, upon seeing how Bumpus was just
content to let himself be hauled out by main strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I, Bob?&rdquo; asked the object of all this solicitude,
as though recognizing the Southern boy as
the one in command, because it had been in his
charge he had submitted his case when the prospects
looked dubious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it would help some, I take it, suh, if you
did make motions like you-all might be a frog swimming
in there,&rdquo; the one appealed to made answer.</p>
<p>And so Bumpus, who had doubtless often watched
a frog swimming so gracefully in the water, started
to give them his conception of what it was like.
Giraffe nearly doubled up with silent laughter, and
only for the proximity of Allan might have made
more or less of a noise; but he succeeded in restraining
his exuberant spirits, and even did some hauling
on the faithful cord that did not fail Bumpus in
this great emergency.</p>
<p>They got him out presently, and while Bumpus
was a sight, with all that black mud clinging to his
legs, so that the rest had to keep away from him,
Davy had the temerity, instead of giving thanks
over the successful rescue of his chum, to go and
mutter something that sounded like:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, now, he&rsquo;ll just <i>have</i> to throw away
that old suit, and the rest of us&rsquo;ll be able to breathe
easy again. Blessings lots of times come along in
disguise, my ma says, and this must be one of &rsquo;em.
And so I&rsquo;m real glad we had to creep along this
slippery ridge after all, because it&rsquo;s going to make
a change in things when we get back to our duffel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep quiet, can&rsquo;t you, Davy!&rdquo; warned Giraffe,
who all the time was chuckling to himself as though
he really enjoyed every word he heard the other
scout say, because Davy was voicing his own sentiments
exactly.</p>
<p>When that suspicious &ldquo;plunk&rdquo; had warned them
all that some one was in the mire, Thad and the
guide had come to a full stop, to wait until the
rescue had been effected. While they were strung
out in that wavering line, what was the interest of
one concerned them all; and there would be little
use in a few of them getting safely over the bog if
the main body were held up out there; because none
of those in the rear could pass by until Bumpus
had been saved.</p>
<p>The fat scout gave Bob White many thankful
looks, and insisted upon the other retaining hold of
that friendly piece of thin rope, because, as often
happens, history might choose to repeat, as one
good turn deserves another, and he did not like
that oozy bed any better after testing its capacity,
than he had before his slip-up.</p>
<p>As for that line, Bumpus would treasure it most
religiously, as one of his most valued possessions;
for had it not saved his life?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>The forward march was resumed, with everybody
hoping that clumsy Bumpus would be much
more careful of his footing now, so that the solid
ground might be reached without more trouble.</p>
<p>Nobody was more anxious than the stout boy
that such a thing might carry; and quite naturally
he exercised all the caution he could muster up in
order to keep from doing that sliding trick again.</p>
<p>When finally he reached solid ground, and actually
felt something firm under his feet, Bumpus
gave a great sigh of thanksgiving and relief. Others
did the same, it may as well be confessed.</p>
<p>First of all, Bumpus restored his bugle to its
customary place at his side. Then, having deposited
his gun on the ground, leaning up against a tree, he
next proceeded to coil up that valuable cord, and
stow the same away inside his khaki jacket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get busy, and scrape some of
that mud off?&rdquo; asked Step Hen, in the ear of the
one who had so recently been saved; whereupon
Bumpus sat him down deliberately, picked up a
stick, and began to reduce the amount of bog which
he was carrying on his person; which operation
some of the others watched in more or less amusement,
particularly Davy, who shook his head, and
grinned as he caught the eye of Giraffe, as much as
to say:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where luck came our way in great big
chunks, Giraffe, because, don&rsquo;t you see, he&rsquo;s just
bound to throw that suit away after getting it in
such a horrible mess, for Thad won&rsquo;t allow him to
tote it along, nohow. Our time is near at hand,
thank goodness; and I say again we&rsquo;re lucky; because
it&rsquo;d almost take an earthquake to make such a
stubborn mule as Bumpus to change his mind, he&rsquo;s
so sot in his ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others had better luck than the fat scout;
several may have slipped a little on the way over,
but no one actually fell in far enough to make a
rescue necessary.</p>
<p>By degrees they came ashore, until presently it
was seen that every one in the expedition had
landed.</p>
<p>The sheriff deemed it a wise piece of precaution
to leave a couple of his men at this point to act as
a guard. If, as Alligator Smith believed, this was
the only means of crossing the fearful muck bed,
then, should they have the misfortune to do anything
that would start the fugitive to action, he
might still be nabbed in the act of trying to get over
to the mainland at this point.</p>
<p>And this having been duly attended to, the rest
of the posse, together with Alligator Smith and the
Boy Scouts, prepared to leave the vicinity of the
quaking bog, and start in among the trees with
which this queer island, looking like an oasis in the
midst of a desert, was pretty well covered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>Every fellow just knew that they must be very
close to the place where the man they were hunting
had his &ldquo;hang-out;&rdquo; and the knowledge caused
them to experience a succession of odd little thrills
that seemed to chase all over their bodies, as though
some one might be pouring ice water down their
backs. But at the same time there was a delightful
sense of expectancy in the air that caused most of
the scouts to feel that the climax to their long journey
must now be at hand.</p>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><span class="small">THE OASIS IN THE QUAKING BOG.</span></h2>
<p>Before they made any sort of a start upon what
would probably be the last leg of their hunt, Thad
believed it would be only a wise move if he and the
sheriff had a little consultation with the man who
was guiding them to where he believed the lair of
the fugitive thief lay.</p>
<p>Thad had always found that a good understanding
in the start was more than half the battle. It
often prevented serious complications from arising,
and mistakes being committed that were apt to
prove fatal to success.</p>
<p>Accordingly he spoke to Alligator Smith along
that line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little hold-up right here and now won&rsquo;t interfere
with our hopes of success, will it, Tom
Smith?&rdquo; was the way he put it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon as how it ain&rsquo;t calkerlated tuh do theh
same, suh,&rdquo; came the reply; for the alligator-skin
collector had learned to have considerable respect
for this thoughtful and resourceful lad who was
serving as scout-master in the absence of Doctor
Philander Hobbs, the real head of the troop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a little bit then, till I get the sheriff alongside,&rdquo;
added Thad. &ldquo;I think we ought to have an
understanding, so there&rsquo;ll be no need of much whispering
later on, when it might upset our calculations
to indulge that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems like yuh mout be k&rsquo;rect thar, son,&rdquo; admitted
the other, readily, and possibly wondering
how it was that this boy seemed to think of everything.</p>
<p>The sheriff quickly joined them when he saw that
something was in the wind. He too had been more
or less impressed by the quiet sense of ability shown
by this Northern lad, who while serving as a leader
among his fellows did not attempt any of the swagger
that many lads could not help displaying.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>&ldquo;Before we start off again, Mr. Sheriff, we
ought to find out a little more of this business, it
seems to me,&rdquo; Thad began; &ldquo;and especially about
the lay of the land; what sort of a shack this is; and
how we&rsquo;d better creep up on the same so as to take
the man by surprise, and at the same time not give
him any chance to endanger the life of the little
girl; because if he&rsquo;s the sort of rascal they say,
he might be small enough to hold her up as a sort
of shield from our guns, and threaten all sorts of
terrible things unless we went away and left him
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known that same to be done, suh,&rdquo; agreed
the official, nodding his head as though he agreed
with what Thad said. &ldquo;And let me say that I understand
jest how ye must feel &rsquo;bout it. We&rsquo;ve
butted in to this game, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s on&rsquo;y right an&rsquo; proper
as how we ought to try an&rsquo; suit our purposes to
yourn. So, whatever ye reckon on as agreeable,
suh, ye&rsquo;ll find us atryin&rsquo; to meet up with ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad gave him a grateful look; for, truth to tell
it was the fear lest some unexpected and unprepared-for
peril threaten the girl before they could
capture the desperate man, that had been worrying
him.</p>
<p>He knew that doubtless among the members of
this hastily summoned sheriff&rsquo;s posse there must be
a number of hotheads, men or boys who were so bent
on accomplishing something that would serve the
ends of justice that, given half a chance and they
would spring forward, risking their lives recklessly
in the hope of being selected by fate as the one to
pull the rascal down.</p>
<p>Many a brilliant plan, Thad knew, had been
spoiled by just such well meaning but thoughtless
individuals. And he was trying to figure it out
how the chances for having such a blunder occur
might be greatly reduced, if not cut out altogether.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>In fact, he had it in his mind that since the posse
now virtually controlled the avenue of escape from
the island, it might be well for the guide and himself,
say, to leave the others near by, and creeping
along, try to find out what Jasper might be doing.</p>
<p>And deep down in his heart Thad possibly was
hoping that if this were undertaken a glorious
chance might arise whereby he could manage to get
in communication with the girl, and even stand by
to protect her while Tom Smith went for the rest;
or else even coax her to flee with him.</p>
<p>The very thought gave Thad a thrill of strange
delight; now that the crisis was so very near, and
he must soon learn the truth, he had great difficulty
in repressing his eagerness, and displaying his customary
caution, when his heart was urging him to
more hasty action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the swamp hunter, as he screwed up
his forehead in a way he had of doing when trying
to &ldquo;cudgel his brains,&rdquo; as the saying is, &ldquo;&rsquo;bout all
I remembers o&rsquo; thet shack she war on&rsquo;y made up
outen slabs an&rsquo; ther like; an&rsquo; seems tuh me like theh
w&rsquo;ar an tear o&rsquo; years&rsquo;d like as not make it look sick.
But then, mebbe as how this heah Jasper he done
tote some more stuff acrost, an&rsquo; patched theh cabin
up so hit&rsquo;d shed water like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it lie among the trees?&rdquo; asked Thad</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure does, suh,&rdquo; replied the other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;How long would it take us to get there from
here?&rdquo; the boy went on to inquire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If so be we started tuh walk reg&rsquo;lar-like, we&rsquo;d
be thar in three minutes I done reckon,&rdquo; answered
Tom Smith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So close as that,&rdquo; muttered the sheriff; &ldquo;I hope
then, none of my posse happens to let out a bark
or a sneeze; seems like that&rsquo;d be heard if a feller
happened to be awake an&rsquo; listenin&rsquo; like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On his part Thad was more concerned about
Bumpus than any of the others; because in the past
on more occasions than one the fat scout had, as
Giraffe expressed it, &ldquo;knocked the fat into the fire,&rdquo;
by some unexpected act. Which explained in part
why the scout-master was wild to accomplish something
looking to the rescue of the little girl before
any such accident could occur.</p>
<p>Why, it had come to such a pass among the scouts
that if a fellow wanted to be very particular about
some group picture he hoped to snap off, he kept
his eye severely on Bumpus all the while; for if he
could make sure that the clumsy member of the patrol
were all right, he had little fear about the rest.
Bumpus had ruined many a picture by some stumble,
or upheaval that was not gratifying to the artist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to ask a favor of you, Mr. Sheriff,&rdquo;
said Thad, suddenly, as he leaned forward, the better
to speak in the other&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then spit her out, son,&rdquo; replied the officer,
though he looked rather surprised, and somewhat
disappointed, just as if he suspected along what
lines this request on the part of the scout might
lie; &ldquo;as I said before, this heah is more your game
than it is ourn, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m willin&rsquo; to let ye have the right
o&rsquo; way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you care very much if Tom Smith and
myself crept on ahead, to see how the ground lay?&rdquo;
asked Thad, determined to take advantage of the
sheriff&rsquo;s kindness while the other was in a mood to
accommodate him.</p>
<p>The officer glanced toward the guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you think that to be a good play, Tom?&rdquo;
he asked; &ldquo;&rsquo;case if ye do, I ain&rsquo;t got a wo&rsquo;d to say
agin the same. This youngster beats my time, an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;m right glad I run up ag&rsquo;inst him. Neveh did
have much use fo&rsquo; Yankees sense they run off my
ole man&rsquo;s slaves yeahs an&rsquo; yeahs ago, leavin&rsquo; the
fambly po&rsquo; as church mice; but if they raise his
breed up thar, I&rsquo;ve got to change my ideas, that&rsquo;s all.
How about that move, Tom Smith: be ye of theh
same mind as him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, possibly the guide had not up to then even
considered such a move; but he was quick to see the
wisdom of it, since Thad had brought the matter
up. He was also too shrewd an old chap to disclose
his ignorance; and accordingly he made out
that he had himself been considering such benefits
as might come to them from a spying expedition,
but through a sense of modesty had refrained from
mentioning it thus far.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wanted tuh say sumpin like thet myself, Shurff,
but didn&rsquo;t know jest how yuh mout take hit,&rdquo; he observed,
complacently; &ldquo;but sense Thad, he opens
the ijee, sot me down as favorin&rsquo; theh same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! all right then, just as you figger, son,&rdquo; the
sheriff went on to say, turning once more to the
young scout-master; &ldquo;but take us along as fur as
ye dar, Smith; and fix it with me so as how if ye
need help suddent-like we&rsquo;ll know it&rsquo;s time to git
busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad felt almost like shaking the hand of the
sheriff again and again, he was so delighted with
the readiness with which the other had fallen in
with his scheme.</p>
<p>Under similar conditions there were many pigheaded
officials, so inflated with a sense of their own
importance, that nothing could have induced them
to yield one atom of their authority in a case like
this. They would have insisted on taking the lead,
and running things as they pleased, no matter if
failure resulted through their recklessness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give a loud whistle if we get in any trouble,
and want you to rush up with the whole
posse,&rdquo; he said, quickly, fearing that unless he
clinched the bargain immediately the sheriff might
repent himself of having made it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>&ldquo;No need of tellin&rsquo; ye to be keerful, son,&rdquo; continued
the other, as Thad and the old swamp guide
prepared to leave the party; &ldquo;because I reckons as
how ye jest couldn&rsquo;t be anything else if ye tried.
Yes, this heah scout business hes cotchcd my fancy
right smart, an&rsquo; I &rsquo;spect to look into the same later
on. Good luck, Thad, and heah&rsquo;s wishin&rsquo; she may
turn out to be all ye hopes fo&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That told the boy the sheriff had a good heart,
even if his business was that of hunting desperate
men, and his face had what would appear to be a
hard look.</p>
<p>None of the other scouts took occasion to say a
single word, because they had not been asked to
share in the consultation. But when they saw Thad
and Alligator Smith preparing to move on ahead,
a short time later, leaving the rest of the posse in
hiding, they could easily guess&mdash;all but Bumpus perhaps,
and he afterwards got his information from
Bob White in the lowest of whispers&mdash;what lured
the pair forward.</p>
<p>So they simply took it out in waving their hands
to Thad when he turned his head to look back; as
though in this mute fashion they might waft after
him their very best wishes for success.</p>
<p>After which the boys settled down to count the
minutes, which would of course drag as though
each one were weighted with lead; hoping that at
any time they might hear the welcome &ldquo;cooee,&rdquo; or
whistle that had come to be known among them as a
signal that their presence was needed in hot haste.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>And it need hardly be stated that every fellow belonging
to the Silver Fox Patrol held himself in
readiness to make the utmost speed in case such a
call came from their leader.</p>
<p>So the utmost silence reigned over that island
oasis amidst the great quaking bog; now and then
some bird would give utterance to a caw or a croak;
but beyond this not a sound could be heard, as they
crouched there, wishing it would come to an end,
and something in the way of excitement follow.</p>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV.
<br /><span class="small">PLAYING &ldquo;SECOND FIDDLE&rdquo; TO A BOY.</span></h2>
<p>Action must now take the place of words, with
Thad.</p>
<p>From the moment that he separated from his
chums, and started off on this scout in company
with the swamp guide, he would have little or no
opportunity to exchange confidences with any one.</p>
<p>It suited his mood exactly, because he was wishing
to do, rather than plan; and gladly welcomed
the opportunity to accomplish something.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>He quickly discovered that Alligator Smith had
changed his course considerably, and could guess
the reason for this. The other judged it best that
they try and come up on the concealed shack where
the fugitive was in all likelihood hidden, from the
other side. And as Tom Smith had been here before,
he undoubtedly must know what he was about.</p>
<p>Being quite content to take things as he found
them, Thad did not even try to ask a single question,
which he might have done by placing his lips
close to the other&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>When the hunter got down, and wriggled along
past some spot that was more open than usual, Thad
followed suit; and it was fortunate that he knew as
much concerning the ways of the tracker as he did,
and could imitate him to the life.</p>
<p>After a little while he saw Smith making motions
as though to call his attention to something ahead.
This caused Thad to find an opening in the brush
that shielded them; and the first thing he saw was
what appeared to be a primitive shelter made of
slabs and branches, though capable of shedding rain,
no doubt.</p>
<p>In front of this a small fire was burning, though
throwing up very little smoke, as the man had been
careful to select such wood as would not give off
the black oozy results that come from Southern pine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>This in itself was enough to tell Thad they were
in luck. A fire could not be started without some
human agency. Undoubtedly Alligator Smith must
have figured correctly when he &ldquo;allowed&rdquo; that this
same Jasper, wishing to remain hidden from everybody
for a time, would come to this former retreat
where, as a boy he had been wont to retire from
the parental wrath.</p>
<p>And if Jasper were here, of course the girl must
be also.</p>
<p>Thad was straining his eyes to the utmost now, in
the wild hope that he might discover her somewhere
by.</p>
<p>He had often thought deeply over this part of
the matter, and wondered whether it would be possible
for him to recognize this girl. Should he
meet her on the street would there be <i>something</i>
about her that must tell him he was looking on a
Brewster?</p>
<p>When he failed to see anything of her, he confessed
to a sense of disappointment; but even as he
looked there was a movement at the door of the
shack, and a man came slowly out.</p>
<p>He was fixing a pipe for a smoke, and seemed
to be entirely at his ease, so Thad made up his
mind that at any rate no suspicion of the danger
that hovered over his head had come to Felix
Jasper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>Lying there perfectly motionless the boy tried
to study the man whom he had come so many hundreds
of miles to find. So this was the unfaithful
steward whom his mother had been compelled to
discharge; and who, it was believed, had revenged
himself in the most cowardly way possible by stealing
the Brewster baby, and so cleverly that all the
detectives who had been hired at great expense to
search for the same, had been unable to accomplish
anything.</p>
<p>No wonder Thad shivered and then grew fiery
hot as he fixed his eyes on the figure of the man
who had once been in the employ of his parents,
and proved treacherous to his trust.</p>
<p>He had always hated the name because he believed
that if Jasper were really to blame for the
disappearance of his baby sister his act had certainly
shortened the life of his dear mother, for
whom Thad had grieved many a year.</p>
<p>Jasper was a slender sort of a man; but then,
knowing this fact already, Thad was more concerned
about his features. He saw that when the
other glanced up and looked around there was a
hunted expression on his face; just as though he
must have known that this last desperate act of his
would make him a much sought prize with all the
sheriffs and marshals of the country.</p>
<p>He must have figured on remaining in hiding for
a certain length of time, after which in some sort
of disguise, and carrying his stolen loot as well as
the girl along, he could make his way to New
Orleans, and take passage on some steamer bound
for a Mexican port, or else one in Central America,
where he could buy a plantation, and live at his ease.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>Neither of the concealed scouts dared move hand
or foot so long as the man was in plain sight; for
the least action might have caught his attention,
with the result that the plans of the sheriff would be
overturned. A dead man was not worth more than
half as much as a live prisoner, to the law.</p>
<p>After puffing away at his pipe for a few minutes
the man knocked it on his heel, as though after all
the flavor did not appeal to him. He looked around
once more, shrugged his shoulders, yawned once or
twice; and then taking out a revolver from a hip
pocket he seemed to be idly turning the cylinder, as
though to make sure the chambers were all loaded.</p>
<p>When Thad saw him yawn again he concluded
that Jasper must be doing more or less sleeping day
and night, to make up for lost time; or else hardly
knew what to do with himself while in hiding.</p>
<p>He did not like the man&rsquo;s face. To his mind it
expressed cunning, and he wondered how any one
could trust him; but then Jasper may not have always
looked this way in those days far back, when
he had charge of the Brewster estate.</p>
<p>Now he was gone again, having passed back into
the shack. Thad could catch what seemed to be
the sound of voices within, and again he felt a
thrill, because this went to prove that the man was
not alone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>If only the girl would show herself, Thad
thought, he would be satisfied. Besides, it might
give him a chance to get in communication with
her, and if such came about there could be no telling
what the happy result might be.</p>
<p>And while he was wishing this it came to pass;
for suddenly the boy realized that she stood there
in front of the lowly shack. Imagine the feelings
that swept over him as he lay there, his eager eyes
fairly glued upon her face.</p>
<p>Yes, she was pretty, but that alone did not occur
to Thad. He believed that he could surely see a
Brewster strain there&mdash;something hard to describe,
but which reminded him of the picture he had of
his father in his own room at home.</p>
<p>So this was the girl Jasper was now calling his
daughter. Why, she no more resembled the man
than she did Bumpus Hawtree; and that was saying
it as strong as any one possibly could, for the fat
scout had a red and freckled face, marked more
by good nature than rare intelligence.</p>
<p>Thad was seized with an almost irresistible impulse
to rush forward and carry her off; but he held
himself in with an iron hand. That would be a silly
thing to attempt, because she would be apt to look
on him with distrust, perhaps call out in wild alarm,
and bring Jasper hurrying to the spot, angry, and
ready to do all sorts of terrible deeds in order to defend
himself against arrest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>As Thad lay there, and watched her every move
he saw the girl stoop down and take hold of a galvanized
bucket which, with other things, Jasper
must have purchased at the time he laid in his supplies
looking to an indefinite stay in the swamp.</p>
<p>She was undoubtedly going to some spring for
water.</p>
<p>Thad never gave the fact of fresh water bubbling
up on that elevated ground in the heart of Alligator
Swamp the slightest thought; though later on
he might consider it a singular thing. What flashed
into his head was the sudden wild hope that in some
way he might cut off her return to the shack; and
thus manage to separate her from her guardian.</p>
<p>As soon as she started away, swinging the bucket
in her hand, and humming some little air that she
had possibly learned in the convent school in New
Orleans, where it was afterwards discovered Jasper
had kept her all these years, Thad gave evidence of
meaning to follow after her.</p>
<p>The old swamp man had kept just as still as the
boy all this time; but somehow he must have divined
what influenced Thad now, for he made no
sign to show that he considered it an unwise thing
to do, but followed along at the heels of the patrol
leader. And perhaps that was the very first
time in all his life that Alligator Smith ever played
&ldquo;second fiddle&rdquo; to a boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>They backed away, first of all, so that another
growth of bushes would come between their moving
bodies and the shack; in case the man chanced to
issue forth again he would not be quite so likely to
discover them as though they kept to the open.</p>
<p>Thad could still catch glimpses of the girl; for
her pail flashed in the sun&rsquo;s rays as she swung it
idly to and fro. Then again her dress happened to
be something along the red order, and in contrast to
the browns and greens of the &ldquo;island&rdquo; in the
quaking bog it stood out vividly.</p>
<p>One thing that pleased Thad was the fact that
the spring would seem to be some little distance
away from the cabin. He felt that every yard
counted in a case of this kind. And too, she was
going in a direction at right angles to the course
that must lead to the place where the sheriff and his
posse lay concealed, waiting to be &ldquo;called to the
feast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He meant that when he disclosed his presence to
the girl he and the swamp guide would be standing
between, so that should she be alarmed, and try to
return, they could prevent such a thing from coming
to pass.</p>
<p>But Thad was fervently hoping that he would be
able to convince her how much it would be to her
interest to at least stop and listen to what he had
to say before either trying to flee, or even raising
a cry to warn Jasper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>Much depended on how she felt toward the man.
If he was a tyrant it would all be easy enough; but
on the other hand, should he have been good to her,
and did she believe him to be really her father,
Thad feared he might have a hard task cut out for
him.</p>
<p>He had made up his mind though, that since the
girl was separated from Jasper she must not be
allowed to rejoin him, even though force had to be
temporarily used in order to effect this result. It
was a glorious chance that had been raised up, and
he would be a queer sort of a scout if he hesitated
to take advantage of the golden opportunity.</p>
<p>And presently he saw that she had reached the
spring, for she was bending down as though to fill
her bucket.</p>
<h2 id="c26">CHAPTER XXVI.
<br /><span class="small">POLLY.</span></h2>
<p>It certainly did seem as though everything might
be trying to assist Thad. Why, even the elements
lent a helping hand; for the wind had only recently
risen to such a busy degree that it was now sighing
among the upper branches of all the trees, and rustling
the leaves of oaks and pines and cypresses until
there was raised such a commingling of various
sounds that possibly one might speak in an ordinary
tone without its being carried from the spring to
where the concealed shack lay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>This was what Thad thought, for with a scout&rsquo;s
education he noticed everything that promised to
have any connection with his affairs.</p>
<p>Providing, then, that the girl would not be so
startled at his sudden and unannounced appearance
that she would cry out, there was a chance of them
carrying on a little heart-to-heart talk, by means
of which he could impart certain facts which must
be of considerable interest to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch out for the coming of the man, while I
try to speak with her,&rdquo; he whispered in the ear of
Alligator Smith; who immediately stopped short,
as though he thought it would be as well to lie in
ambush right there, as go on any further.</p>
<p>Thad forgot all about his companion after that.</p>
<p>The girl was still by the spring. She had set her
pail down, and was on her knees. Thad could not
see exactly what she was doing, but imagined that
it might either be getting a drink, or else in girlish
fashion utilizing the clear water of the spring as a
mirror, to look at her reflection.</p>
<p>A dozen quick, noiseless paces served to bring him
close up to where she knelt. He managed to get
control of himself, and give a little cough, as though
in this fashion he hoped to alarm her less than by
suddenly speaking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>The girl instantly turned her head. He saw that
she was astonished, and immediately Thad pressed
his finger on his lips to beg of her not to call out.
At the same time he tried to have a reassuring
smile on his face, though in his excitement he hardly
knew what he must look like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t call out to betray me to that man!&rdquo;
he said, softly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean you the least harm.
In fact, I have come all the way down from the
North just to speak with you. Will you believe me
enough to listen, while I tell you something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was on her feet now, and at first Thad feared
he had so alarmed her that her whole desire would
be to run as fast as she could to the shack, perhaps
screaming out loud, in her desire to have Jasper
hasten to her assistance. In that event he had made
up his mind to seize her, and then depend on the
guide to hold the angry man at bay when he came
rushing up.</p>
<p>But if this was indeed her first intention she
must have soon changed her mind. Possibly the
friendly reassuring smile on his eager face influenced
her; then again she may have been braver than
he had ever imagined could be the case; and last of
all perhaps she knew more about her past than it
had entered his mind to imagine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, boy, if you promise not to come any nearer
to me than you are now, I will hear what you want
to say,&rdquo; she replied, in a voice that quivered with
nervousness, fear, and perhaps anxiety. &ldquo;But how
could you ever find your way over here, when he
told me no living person knew of that trail under
the mud.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>&ldquo;There was one man who knew about it,&rdquo; Thad
went on to say, softly, thinking it wise to approach
the wonderful subject that he wanted to speak
about by degrees, and first of all satisfy her girlish
curiosity. &ldquo;But first of all, tell me if you believe
the man you are with is your own father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says he is, but somehow I do not believe
him,&rdquo; she replied, drawing a long breath, while her
eyes opened wider than before, as though hopes
that had lain half dormant in her heart for some
time, once more flashed into life. &ldquo;At the convent
school the sisters often talked about him, and they
could not believe he was my father. He gave his
name as Allan; but once when he came to see me
an empty envelope fell from his coat pocket, and I
saw that it was addressed to Felix Jasper; so ever
since I&rsquo;ve believed that must mean him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you guessed what was true,&rdquo; said Thad,
quickly, pleased beyond measure at what success
had already come to him in his suddenly arranged
plans; &ldquo;his right name is Felix Jasper. Years ago
he used to be in charge of my mother&rsquo;s property,
just after my father died; but he took advantage
of her inexperience to defraud her and was discharged,
but not prosecuted. Instead of being
grateful he seemed to lie awake nights trying to
think up something dreadful, through which he
might have revenge for what he considered his
wrongs. It is an old story, but happens now and
then, just as it used to do centuries ago. My little
baby sister disappeared most mysteriously, and was
never found, though they hunted everywhere. Jasper
was careful not to give the least clue; but my
mother believed until she died that he was to blame.
And now, many years afterwards, word reached my
uncle and guardian that this same Felix Jasper was
seen coming into this swamp, having a girl in his
company who seemed to be just about as old as my
little sister Pauline must have been if she were alive.
And I have come down here to find out if it might
be true. Now you know why I asked you not to
call out! You do not love that man, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have hardly seen him more than four or five
times in as many years, until he came two weeks
ago, and told me I would have to leave the convent
school, and go with him, because he had to live
abroad. And then we came here to this queer spot,
and he has acted so strangely all the while, as
though he feared some one might be meaning to do
him an injury. Ever so many times a day I have
seen him examining a terrible pistol he carries in
his pocket. Is it you he is afraid of, boy?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think it is,&rdquo; replied Thad; &ldquo;you
see he is a thief, and has robbed a wealthy planter
who employed him; so that he is afraid the sheriff
and his posse will find him. And they are here close
by, meaning to arrest him; so that you must not go
back there to that shack, for it would be too dangerous.
But if you believe that he could not be your
real father, have you not sometimes tried to picture
who was, and what your right name might be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, oh! yes, I have, many, many times,&rdquo; she
went on to say, breathlessly, so that Thad was emboldened
to take a step toward her, and follow it
up with another. &ldquo;And then there was that day
when the sisters showed me the clothes that were
on me when he brought me there as a baby, saying
that my mother had died, and he had to go abroad
on a very important mission. I shall never forget
that there were three letters embroidered on one of
the garments; and oh! how often I used to dream
that the day <i>might</i> come when I could know whether
my name were really Mary Allen, or something else
that those initials stood for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Thad, his very heart seeming to
stop beating, because everything might depend on
what answer she would make to the question he
meant to ask her now; &ldquo;tell me, were those three
letters P. C. B?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you have said them just as I saw them!&rdquo;
she exclaimed, in sudden awe, not unmixed with
ecstacy; and Thad breathed freely again, while his
face lighted up with a joy that could no longer be
denied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>&ldquo;They stand for Pauline Chester Brewster!&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;and I do not for a minute doubt but that
you are my own dear little sister; but all that can
be settled when we see those sisters you speak of, in
New Orleans, and the garments they have kept all
these years are shown. You will not be afraid of
me any longer, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was drawing very close to her when he said
this. The little girl&rsquo;s bright eyes were fastened
upon his face. What she saw there must have given
her complete confidence in the boy, for she suddenly
extended both hands toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am not afraid of you. Why should I be
when you have brought me such splendid news?
And you look just like what I have always thought
a brother must be. Oh! I do hope I won&rsquo;t wake
up and find that it&rsquo;s all only a dream; because that
has happened so many times. It always made me
cry, because I was so very much disappointed. But
then this time it seems different, because I&rsquo;ve heard
you speak, and you have told me the things I&rsquo;ve
always wanted to know. And so my name is
Pauline?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, or Polly for short,&rdquo; the delighted boy went
on, as he took both her extended hands in his; &ldquo;do
you think you will like it better than Mary? It was
my mother&rsquo;s name too, and she was a Chester before
she married my father. I am Thad Brewster,
your own brother Thad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>&ldquo;How queer it seems to me&mdash;to have a real
brother,&rdquo; she went on to say; &ldquo;but oh! we forget
about <i>him</i>. He will be very, very angry if he finds
me talking to you in this way; because he has always
told me I must never say a single word to a
stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s different when you&rsquo;re talking with
your brother, you see,&rdquo; Thad replied; but her words
had awakened him to the fact that it was most unwise
to continue to linger so close to the shack
where Jasper was staying; and that the safest
policy would be for them to reach the spot where
Sheriff Badgely and his posse lay concealed, and
leave the rest to that astute peace official.</p>
<p>He wondered at such a young girl talking so well,
but then she had been all of her life in the charge
of the sisters at the convent school, and consequently
was somewhat old-fashioned in her ways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what will you do about it?&rdquo; she asked
him; &ldquo;because I am sure he will never let me go
away with you, even if you are my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to ask him,&rdquo; Thad told her. &ldquo;All
you have to do is to walk off now with me, and we
can laugh at him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! but you don&rsquo;t know what a terrible man he
can be!&rdquo; she said, laying a little hand earnestly on
his sleeve; &ldquo;once I saw him furiously angry, and
he frightened me very much, even if he did tell me
I mustn&rsquo;t think he was meaning me when he said
such awful things. He will follow after us, and do
something wicked, I know he will.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he will follow us,&rdquo; said Thad, with perfect
confidence; &ldquo;because then he may step into a
trap, and have his teeth drawn without being able
to do anybody harm. But come, let us hurry off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seemed to have the utmost faith in this boy
who had so suddenly dawned upon her horizon with
the astonishing claim that he was her own real
brother; for without hesitation she was about to
take his hand, when suddenly she gave utterance to
a piteous little cry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! dear, I just knew it would turn out like it
always does!&rdquo; she exclaimed; and Thad, seeing that
she was looking past him in a sort of daze, instantly
turned his own head to ascertain what had
caused this new alarm.</p>
<p>What he saw was not reassuring. There not
twenty feet away stood the man of the shack, Felix
Jasper. He was holding something that glistened
in his right hand; and seemed both angry and astounded
to see a stranger here on his private island
that was guarded by that supposed to be impassable
bog.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<h2 id="c27">CHAPTER XXVII.
<br /><span class="small">MR. JASPER SURPRISED.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move, you!&rdquo; the man called out, threateningly;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you covered; and I&rsquo;m desperate
enough to shoot, if you rile me just so far. Get
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad managed to preserve his level head in spite
of the seriousness of the conditions. It had always
been one of his strongest points that when an
emergency arose he could calmly meet it. In times
past this sterling trait had placed him head and
shoulders above the other scouts, and had considerable
to do with making him the assistant scoutmaster
of Cranford Troop.</p>
<p>He knew that this man was in a frame of mind
to do almost anything wicked. He had always been
a bad man, and now that his whole future depended
on his getting safely out of the country with the
plunder he had lately stolen, it was not likely he
would let anything stand in his way.</p>
<p>Thad began to use some of the shrewdness that
a scout should always aim to have at his command
when placed in a position of this sort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>He saw something moving just a little way behind
Jasper, and quickly realized that this must be
the swamp guide. Alligator Smith had allowed the
man to pass him by, but he was now creeping up
like a panther back of him, advancing inches at a
time, but with the utmost care, and meaning when
the proper second came to spring upon Jasper&rsquo;s
shoulders.</p>
<p>So Thad knew that it was his duty to hold the
attention of the man in some way or other, until his
confederate could cover the little space that still
separated him from his intended victim.</p>
<p>Once let Tom Smith make that plunge, and the
chances were he would fix matters, so that Jasper
would not be left in any condition to do further
damage.</p>
<p>Above all else Thad knew that under no consideration
must he allow the man to suspect that he was
only trying to hold his attention for a deep purpose.
And in order to make the matter stronger Thad determined
to stagger Jasper by revealing his identity.
Anything at all so that he could cause him to remain
just where he was, and allow the other to reach him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I surrender, all right, so please don&rsquo;t think
of using your gun. It isn&rsquo;t at all necessary, you
see!&rdquo; and as he said this the boy held up his hands,
both of which were free; for he had allowed his
rifle to fall to the ground at the time he seized upon
the extended hands of the girl, outstretched to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>&ldquo;However did you get over here: and what&rsquo;s that
uniform mean?&rdquo; demanded Jasper, who was apparently
almost stunned with surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you see, I belong to the Boy Scouts,&rdquo; remarked
Thad, off-hand; &ldquo;and you must know
they&rsquo;re always interested in boats, motorcycles,
aeroplanes and all such things. And it looks like a
fellow would need a flying machine to cross that
sink of mud around this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An aeroplane! You an air pilot?&rdquo; exclaimed
the man, hardly knowing whether it could be true,
or that this boy might be deceiving him for a purpose.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d never believe it unless you showed me
your machine. What were you doing holding the
hands of my daughter? There&rsquo;s something more
about this thing than you&rsquo;ve admitted! I&rsquo;m beginning
to suspect that you came here with some purpose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only another minute, Thad expected, would be
necessary; Alligator Smith was making good progress,
and must soon be in position to hurl himself
upon the unsuspecting Jasper, wrestling with these
staggering facts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s right, Mr. Jasper, I did come here
for a good reason!&rdquo; Thad went on to say composedly,
hoping that he could manage to hold the
attention of the other just a brief space of time
longer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>&ldquo;You know me!&rdquo; gasped the man, still further
amazed; &ldquo;who are you, boy? I demand that you
tell me, and in a hurry too, if you understand what&rsquo;s
good for you.&rdquo; and he made a significant movement
with the hand that gripped the pistol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is one you&rsquo;ve heard before, Mr. Jasper.
I&rsquo;m Thad Brewster!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was almost like a thunderclap to the rascal.
It must have brought up before his mind&rsquo;s eye many
things connected with his wretched past. When he
had succeeded in digesting it better no doubt he
would show signs of anger; he might even think of
raising his hand to do the lad injury; because when
one has bitterly wronged another he is apt to hate
him in the bargain. But just then Jasper was too
utterly astonished to even show rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You Thad Brewster?&rdquo; he cried out, his hand
falling to his side from weakness, as he stared into
the face of the boy who stood there, and calmly confronted
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I have come to find my little sister,
Pauline, the girl you stole away from my mother
many years ago. There&rsquo;s no use in saying that you
didn&rsquo;t, because I have plenty of proof. Why, anybody
could tell from her looks alone that she was a
Brewster. And of course you&rsquo;ll let her go back
with me, Mr. Jasper. You must have long ago repented
having been so cruel to my poor mother,
who died, mostly from grieving after her lost baby.
You can go your way, and let Pauline be with me.
You will, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>Of course Thad was talking in this way for the
simple reason that he must say something to hold
the attention of the man, because the critical moment
was close at hand. And he had really taken
the strongest measures possible for riveting the
mind of Jasper upon what he was saying. A dozen
seconds more, and it would all be over; so the scoutmaster
was determined that he would continue to
grip Jasper&rsquo;s mind for that length of time.</p>
<p>The man laughed, now, a little hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all the nerve I ever met up with, you take the
premium!&rdquo; he remarked, with a vein of sarcasm in
his voice. &ldquo;I guess you are a Brewster, all right,
and a chip of the old block in the bargain. But
you&rsquo;re off your reckoning if you think I&rsquo;m going to
let that little girl get away from me. Why, I&rsquo;m
just beginning to care for her; and in some distant
country she&rsquo;ll make me a fine, dutiful daughter for
my old age. And it&rsquo;ll be a sweet morsel for me to
roll under my tongue, having a child of Henry
Brewster to wait on me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she is my sister; you don&rsquo;t try to deny
that, do you?&rdquo; demanded the boy, like a flash.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I, when it adds to my pleasure to
see you hate to lose her?&rdquo; answered the other; and
then beginning to scowl savagely he went on to say
while he waved his deadly weapon to and fro:
&ldquo;however you came over here, you&rsquo;re not going
back again in a hurry, to betray me to my enemies.
I&rsquo;ll just tie you up, neck and crop, and perhaps leave
you here, monarch of all you survey, when Polly
and myself make up our minds to skip out. Don&rsquo;t
move a finger now, boy, or it will be the worse for
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;ve got both hands held up, as you see;
and as there&rsquo;s all of twenty feet between us, why I
couldn&rsquo;t do anything even if I wanted to. But would
money induce you to let me take my sister away
with me? You always liked money, Mr. Jasper;
and if you saw a chance to make twenty thousand
dollars perhaps you&rsquo;d change your mind, and go off
without Polly. Huh! I guess you will, anyway.
Whoop! hold him tight, Tom Smith; and here&rsquo;s
helping you if you need it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The swamp hunter had finally made his leap, and
with such success that he landed on the back of
Jasper, bearing the rascal heavily to the ground.
Of course the man struggled furiously; but he was
as a pigmy in the grip of the stalwart alligator-skin
hunter, who not only prevented him from using the
weapon he held, but forced him to drop the same, by
bending back his arm until he almost broke it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>Thad jumped forward, and secured the dangerous
weapon; after which felt that the case was
so nearly settled that it would be safe to call the
rest of the sheriff&rsquo;s posse up. Accordingly he let
out a loud &ldquo;cooee&rdquo; that would mean a whole lot to
the balance of the scouts; and almost immediately
he heard them tearing along, fairly wild to reach
the spot, and see what was happening.</p>
<p>And when they did come hurrying up, imagine
the delight of Bumpus, Giraffe and the rest at discovering
Thad standing there, holding the hand of
the girl, and looking happier than they could ever
remember seeing him before; while Alligator Smith
was covering the prostrate form of Jasper with his
angular body.</p>
<h2 id="c28">CHAPTER XXVIII.
<br /><span class="small">THE MYSTERY SOLVED&mdash;CONCLUSION.</span></h2>
<p>The sheriff was satisfied to find that he had the
much sought thief in his hands, and that the stolen
property of the rich planter turned up after a search
of the interior of the shack; though some of the
younger elements in his posse felt a bit disappointed
because they had had such a small part to play in the
affair, the honors of which seemed to go to Thad
and the swamp ranger.</p>
<p>As for the scouts, they were fairly wild with delight
over the successful outcome of their trip into
Dixie. Thad declared that they would make for
New Orleans as soon as possible, where he expected
to interview the sisters at the convent school at
which Pauline had been kept for years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>Jasper, after he had recovered in a measure from
his bitter disappointment, began to show a yellow
streak. Perhaps he cherished a faint hope that if
he tried to make amends Thad might interest himself
in seeking to have his punishment lightened; as
though anything the boy could do would make a
difference with the stern justice of the law he had
defied so long.</p>
<p>He admitted before them all that the girl was the
Brewster baby, and that he had been guilty of stealing
her, just to get even with those whom he hated
because he had wronged them, and had been found
out. Thad was wise enough to get him to write out
a confession, and have the sheriff and several others
witness the same. He believed that this would be
enough to prove that Pauline was his long lost
sister. But all the same Thad did go to New Orleans
with his chums later on, and made sure to get
the little garments which the sisters had kept all
these years, and which they affirmed had been upon
the child when she was first brought to them by the
man who called himself her father, and who paid
well to have her taken care of.</p>
<p>They left the strange island in the heart of the
quaking bog in the same way they had reached it.
And Jasper thus learned that after all he had not
been the only one who knew about that hidden
ridge, by following which the treacherous bed of
slime could be safely crossed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>When the scouts once more arrived at the spot
where their boats had been left they concluded to
spend the night in camp. Alligator Smith would
not leave them; but the sheriff was eager to get
back with his prisoner and the loot, so that he might
claim the rich reward that had been offered for the
capture of the man, and the safe return of the
stolen property.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our last night in old Alligator Swamp, boys,&rdquo;
said Allan, as the afternoon began to wear along,
and found them very comfortable, with the tents
erected, and a cheery fire blazing near by, &ldquo;and let&rsquo;s
make it a memorable one by every means in our
power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we&rsquo;re meaning to have a real pleasant evening,&rdquo;
spoke up Davy Jones, with a determined look
upon his face; &ldquo;then I move that the first thing we
do is to make Bumpus here sink his old suit in the
swamp, and put on his nice clean one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second the motion; and all in favor say aye!&rdquo;
shouted Giraffe, excitedly.</p>
<p>A loud shout attested that the desire was unanimous.
Even Thad nodded his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve sure been a patient crowd, Bumpus, as
you&rsquo;ll admit,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and now that you&rsquo;ve gone
and got that nasty mud plastered all over you, we&rsquo;ve
reached the end of the rope. Here, take that jacket
off, and hand it to me. I&rsquo;ve got an idea the truth is
about to come out. Oh! no wonder some of the
boys have been complaining about this. See here,
Bumpus, your cold is better, isn&rsquo;t it? You can begin
to sniff around some again, can&rsquo;t you? Well,
just take a whiff of this coat, and tell me what you
think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus proceeded to do so, while the rest of the
boys awaited the result. Sure enough, the round,
jolly face of the fat scout immediately screwed itself
up as if he were not favorably impressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put your hand in the inside pocket, Bumpus,&rdquo;
continued Thad, severely, &ldquo;because I think you&rsquo;ll
find a little package done up in paper there, and
which you&rsquo;ve been wondering about this long while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shout went up from the other boys when Bumpus
did fetch out a small but very <i>powerful</i> packet,
tied with the red cord used by druggists in their
business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; ejaculated the astounded Bumpus, staring
hard at the contents of his hand; &ldquo;would you
believe it, that&rsquo;s the very package I&rsquo;ve been worrying
my head off about, and never able to say whether
I gave it to my ma, or left it at the house of some
fellow I visited on the way home!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Thad went on to say, &ldquo;you put it in the
pocket of your old jacket; and when you got home
just rolled that up, and stowed it in your knapsack,
because we were off the very next day. And when
you put that suit on down here, you had such a bad
cold in the head you never guessed a thing about it.
Bumpus, do you know what that awful stuff is?
Why, it&rsquo;s just asafetida, one of the rankest drugs
going. Most people have to keep it out in the barn,
because it&rsquo;s pretty nearly as bad as a skunk to have
around. Perhaps your mother wanted to use it for
a cold. I think that&rsquo;s what they buy it for; and according
to my mind it would scare any respectable
cold off in one inning. Now, you just take this coat,
and sink it as deep as you can in the swamp; yes,
get in your tent and change to your new suit.
We&rsquo;ve stood about all we can of this thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus looked around at his seven chums, and
grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to think that I&rsquo;d find that lost package
after all; and had it along with me all the time, but
didn&rsquo;t know it,&rdquo; he went on to say, as though this
struck him as the most remarkable part of the whole
affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we knew it, all the same,&rdquo; avowed Davy;
&ldquo;and after you&rsquo;ve loaded that suit with a stone, and
sunk five feet deep, perhaps we&rsquo;ll accept you again
as a member in good standing. But you sure are
the most stubborn fellow that ever lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, my mind&rsquo;s relieved of a load,&rdquo; affirmed
Bumpus, composedly; &ldquo;because I know now
what I did with that lost package.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>He soon made the change, and then some of the
boys went with him to see that he buried the strong
smelling garments where they would never come
back again; which ceremony was conducted with all
manner of laughter and boyish jokes.</p>
<p>True to his promise Step Hen did manage to secure
that musket which the cunning Jasper had used
in constructing his man-trap; and spent an hour extracting
the load from the rusty barrel. He confessed
himself very much disappointed, however,
because, after all, it proved to contain only a single
bullet instead of the handful of missiles that he had
prophesied would be found packed away there.
But he took the old weapon away with him, and declared
he would hang it from the wall in his den at
home, to remind him of other days.</p>
<p>In New Orleans Thad easily procured all the further
evidence needed to prove that the girl whom he
had found with Jasper was really his own true little
sister Pauline; and when the scouts once more
reached Cranford there was quite a furore in the
town over the successful outcome of the boys&rsquo; trip
South.</p>
<p>Thad had even asked the sheriff about the escaped
black convicts said to be hiding in Alligator Swamp,
and whom he expected to round up with his posse
after placing Jasper in a place of security; and
when Giraffe and the rest heard that there was
really a fellow who was minus the third finger of
his left hand, they gave the patrol leader great
credit for reading the signs of the trail aright.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>Having accomplished the one important mission
that had taken them down into Dixie, and successfully
navigated the numerous perilous channels
upon which their boats had embarked, it should not
be necessary for us to accompany the Silver Fox
Patrol any further in these pages; but we shall
surely hope and expect to meet with Thad Brewster
and his chums again at some time in the near future;
for such wide-awake and enterprising scouts
must of necessity constantly encounter new and
interesting adventures which would be worth while
telling. Until that time arrives, then, we will ring
down the curtain, and say good-bye.</p>
